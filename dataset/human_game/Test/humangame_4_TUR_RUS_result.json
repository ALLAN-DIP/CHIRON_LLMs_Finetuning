I don't, not without SEV and not after giving up the ION as you're suggesting. Also, why would I be giving up ION in this scenario anyway if not to allow your ally Italy to come back at me by sea. And I don't know where you get 9 from? 6 + 2 - 1 = 7 then you're really going to support me into RUM in the fall *as well* as the 2 I got from Austria? So you get 1 and I get 3, that's really the deal you're happy with? Still totals to 8 by the way but we both know you have no intention of supporting me into RUM in the Fall. You will be attacking RUM with 3 while Italy tries to push through by sea. It doesn't take a genius to see that. Next time try and suggest a deal that actually has some appearance of sincerity otherwise it's just too easy to see through.'.",
