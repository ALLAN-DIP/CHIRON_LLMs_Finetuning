I cant stop laughing at \"I didn't mean to take Naples\". In my experience, the best way not to take something is to not attack it. That's just what I've found but I guess you've got other methods of not taking something haha, of course you meant to take Naples and of course we both know that this game has been over for a few seasons. It's all the same at this point. Good game, well played. If you're trying to rack up lies with me I wouldn't bother. I have to conclude that that's the only point for all of them the last few seasons or is it just for fun? If its just for fun, carry on, I dont mind. If its for the successful lie counter, Russia is a better option for that I think?",
