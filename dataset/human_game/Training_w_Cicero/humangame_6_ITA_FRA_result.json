        "output": "You should trust the message. France's proposal of a DMZ in Piedmont aligns with their message of wanting to avoid a war, which indicates a potential interest in maintaining a peaceful relationship with you. Your planned move of A VEN to hold also doesn't suggest aggression towards France, making it a suitable response to their offer."

        "output": "You should not trust the message. The sudden change in tone from a friendly proposal to a more urgent-sounding inquiry without any significant development in the game suggests potential inconsistency in France's intentions, possibly indicating a shift in their strategy towards you. Be cautious and consider seeking more context before fully trusting France in this situation."

        "output": "You should not trust the message. France's mention of a Lepanto or attacking Austria early contrasts with their previous suggestions of establishing a DMZ and avoiding conflict, indicating potential duplicity in their intentions towards you. Given the change in tone and strategy proposed, it would be prudent to approach France's messages with caution and consider alternative diplomatic options."
