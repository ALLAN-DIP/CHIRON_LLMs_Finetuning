I'll have to admit, I was caught off guard by your entrance into Trieste, but I think it could work out well for you. \n\nI would like to ask if I will be bounced if I move to VIE, and if you have any other plans for the future that might be to both of our benefit?'.If the cicero recommended order for me is: F ION - TUN, A VEN - TYR, A TRI - VIE.
