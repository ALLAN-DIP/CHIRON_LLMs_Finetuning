Should I trust RUSSIA?",
        "output": "'You should trust the message.' Russia has explicitly stated their peaceful intentions towards you and their actions in Spring 1901 aligned with this message by not moving their army from Moscow to St. Petersburg as they promised. It is in their best interest to maintain a positive relationship with you as a neighbor and focus on other areas of the board."
