You can hold StP easily, get 2 builds, prevent France from getting any, and change the balance of power pretty dramatically.\n\nIf you really trust France you could also convoy to Holland and take a stab at crippling me permanently - he'll get +1 or +2, you'll get +2.  Though you risk bouncing with France if he gets greedy.  But if he builds, and you see a F Mar, you're in for a rough go.  If it's me, convoy to Belgium is the smarter play.  I don't even see it as a stab on your end - our alliance was three-way, and it is broken.  If you weren't in on it, it's broken for all of us.",

I was waiting for Turkey to stab Russia to give you an opening.  It didn't come, so I tried to force it and opened myself.
