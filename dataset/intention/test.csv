Hopefully I can convince them to just take Rum with the fleet...', ""Alright, them not responding to me and pushing north makes me think they don't really have any desire to work with me.

So I’m game to try and out guess them with you, but I think Russia is looking for an ally anywhere.  If you offered an alliance with them (real or fake) they would probably take it.  For example if you offered to convoy to Den while they drop into Bal, they’d probably do that, setting off an R/G war (not sure if you want that, but you could).', 'Seems like you and Germany are already teaming up on France, so you can probably keep Russia contained in the north without too much effort, right?', ""I'm not teaming on France.

It's just weird how russia isn't making any moves for depots in the north and seems to be letting germany just have at it."", ""Russia didn't move because they lost track of time, it wasn't intentional, I'm sure.  I haven't heard from them since the Spring moves."", ""Okay, I wasn't sure if had been some mind gaming or what happened."", 'No, they totally screwed their position by not moving - look in the south!', ""Yeah, that's why I wasnt sure if they were just playing really passive to try some trick.

If we each take on one while the other goes after the other, we’ll kinda split the board up but it’ll be slow.  If we pick the same enemy, it’ll go faster, but we’ll have to leave ourselves a little undefended in the opposite side.  I go after Russia, most likely France grows big in the Med.  You go after France, Russia is breathing down your neck.  That’s my main concern: how do I go after Russia if I know France will quickly be taking control of Italy?  Can we somehow keep France tied down so we’re free to mostly focus on Russia?', 'Wow, did France actually stab you? In this position?!?  Doesn’t he know you can throw your remaining strength into making sure he dies, to spite the stab?

Are you leaning towards working with England, or France?"", ""It seems for the moment that both are cooperative, but I'm likely to side with the French from the outset barring difficulties with them. I'll keep you posted, same relationship as previously established. In any case, friendship with the French is not very likely to last past England's demise so I'll definitely need the help then.

Hopefully I'll be on the winning side of a conflict against Turkey or Austria by then, which should put us in position to squeeze France"", ""I'd greatly prefer you end up on Austria's side of that conflict all things considered, but if things don't go his way I wouldn't blame you for siding against them."", 'Definitely understandable.

That's my usual go-to as Germany lol"", 'Have you talked more with Austria?

They didn't even move towards you, and after hearing what you said I talked with Austria, and they said they were going to attack Russia, so I don't think there is an alliance there. I would instead invest in capturing english territory, which would give you troops to build in your homeland and defend against Russia if they choose to attack you."", ""Fair enough, I'll focus on the English first then."", 'Ok, and will you be supporting me into Burgundy?

Sooo, ig the game is in grace period, so I was wondering what you builds were looking like.

Unfortunately it seems the British called my bluff early and the Russians have committed to taking Sweden, so things aren't exactly ideal, but we're still in a pretty definitively winning position."", 'Russians really fucked me up by not bouncing me in Sweden. Good move on their part.', ""Hey Germany. It's a shame Russia called your bluff. I will support helgoland into nth with both of my fleets. We should have a 100% chance of getting in if you attack Nwy with sweden and cut support. This is the best move for sweden in any scenario, as that territory is basically lost, and who knows, maybe england will move Nwy to Stp and you will end up getting Nwy"", 'Yeah, the only worry is that England will move North Sea to Denmark, which would be a damn shame and a pain in my ass.', ""And if they're displaced they could *retreat* there, which would just add insult to injury."", ""Ah, good point. I don't have anything for Pic to do, do you think I should have Eng convoy it over to whales?

You probably know I have an alliance with france, and they have troops right next to you. They told me that they were going to support themselves into Piedmont. I\'m letting you know because I\'m worried about them getting too strong and stabbing me, as they already have 6 centers."" Or something like that, just in your own words. I want them to think I\'m supporting myself into Piedmont.', ""Picardy can stay put for now, I think that the English will anticipate us doing something other than trying to take the North Sea and will move to prevent it, if they think we're thinking far enough ahead.

Austria's betrayal of Italy in favor of Turkey is really telling so I think I'll have my hands full on that front soon enough. A two way victory sounds splendid to me."", 'How will we split Britain?', ""Um, so this turn I think I'm going to support myself into london, but also support you into the Nth sea. From there you can take Edi, and I can support you into that."", ""Nah, focus on succeeding in London, poke North Sea with Belgium so that it can't support. I'm supporting myself into Sweden and moving on Norway from there; if you want to simplify things we could have you take all of Britain and just transfer Belgium to me (So that we both net 2 from the British, since I'll have Norway), though I would understand why you might be uncomfortable with that."", ""I'm really torn over what to do in Italy. I spoke to Austria about going after them together, and they are thinking about it. I could try convoying Mar into Tuscany, with Pie supporting. This is basically the same as just moving Pie into Tuscany, with support from my fleet, except for that if I convoy Mar the support is less likely to be cut(I think there is a higher chance they will cut support to my fleet than cut support/move to Piedmont)"", ""The Austrians are currently making a whole slew of bad decisions, allying with the Turks is a sucker's bet. I'm not sure what you should do tbh, the Italians aren't talking to me much anymore."", ""I suppose we could have me take all of Britain, and have me give you Belgium, but I would ask that as soon as you take Belgium, you move back out. It's definitely an option, but I will have to think about it."", ""Oh of course, once I had it I'd get out of there immediately. Trust is the key in transfers like this."", ""Take your time, we've got several turns until it needs settling, and several days till the next turn."", ""I could move Piedmont to Tyr, it's a great place to be.

Want to be able to move in as fast as possible on the Austrians when we go for it."", 'What do you think the next move should be?', 'Could you support Bel to Nth?', ""Absolutely. My fleet in Denmark wouldn't be doing anything otherwise. Are you moving in with Piedmont or Tyrolia?

My recommendation is: \nA: VIE S TYR - BOH\nA: WAR - UKR\nA: STP - MOS\nA: BUD - GAL\nI: TYR - BOH\nI: TRI - TYR\nI: VEN - PIE\nI: TUS S VEN - PIE\nT: SEV - UKR\nT: RUM S WAR - UKR\nT: ANK - SEV (Convoy)\n\nThis plan destroys UKR or ensures that we control it.  It places units in places that they can cut supports on Warsaw which dramatically increases our odds of taking it back if we loose it or maintaining it if we don't.  Chances are, if STP is dislodged, it will be able to retreat to LVN.    Worst case is that Germany just rotates his armies north - supporting himself into LVN and getting three on Warsaw (LVN, PRU, and SIL.  But, we'll either be in Moscow or Galicia (probably both) and Ukraine.  We'll also have two on Munich and he can either keep munich or go after Warsaw.\n\nThe other option is to support ourselves into Galicia and Ukraine.  I'm willing to do as you suggest."", 'I like your first plan with the moves all laid out', 'Sorry for taking so long', 'I should have supported you into Ukraine.', 'It is what it is', 'I flipped a coin.

Let me know if you're interested and we can coordinate moves.\nLooking forwards to a great game, and good luck!"", ""Hello France, I too am interested in moving east with you and I think a channel DMZ is a great idea.
