In the first year, Russia told me he was working with you against Turkey. Somehow, when the orders were read, Turkey had convinced both you and Russia to work with him.', 'So it seems like Turkey has been playing both sides from the start.', ""I'm not trying to be super nosy, and I apologize in advance if I am coming off that way, but for my long term interests it is pretty important that Turkey doesn't start explosively growing and wiping out half of the map.

I guess they want to try and keep us from becoming allies. How about this - you take Rum with support and I take the Black Sea. I get BLA for insurance and you get Rum which gives you an extra build. I will try for Greece and might get it then we will be set up to attack Austria"", ""To be honest, I don't really want you to have BLA. I'm just not there yet (although probably will be eventually).

Yes, Austria is spreading a lot of misinformation, to Italy as well as us. There are three things here and I can only give up one otherwise I'm putting myself under way too much risk. Its either 1) you taking RUM by yourself and I wont try and stop it 2) black sea DMZ (but we'd need to bounce it) 3) me supporting you into Rum. Whichever one you take, I can't give up any of the others. I would be too far onto the back foot with you getting a freebe in the North and Austria seemingly coming for me. 1902 will be a big year and if we work this out and we play it as allies then we can both have a lot of trust going into next year which will  be really valuable."", ""I would really like a lot of trust between us, as our alliance can be insanely powerful.

In the short-term then you have 3 to attack RUM with. Also, you think I can hold off you, Italy and Austria at the same time? I don't, not without SEV and not after giving up the ION as you're suggesting. Also, why would I be giving up ION in this scenario anyway if not to allow your ally Italy to come back at me by sea. And I don't know where you get 9 from? 6 + 2 - 1 = 7 then you're really going to support me into RUM in the fall *as well* as the 2 I got from Austria? So you get 1 and I get 3, that's really the deal you're happy with? Still totals to 8 by the way but we both know you have no intention of supporting me into RUM in the Fall. You will be attacking RUM with 3 while Italy tries to push through by sea. It doesn't take a genius to see that. Next time try and suggest a deal that actually has some appearance of sincerity otherwise it's just too easy to see through."", ""Well... that was harsh. Let me just put a few things straight. Me and Italy is not a thing. I communicated with them the first year about a potential mid game alliance, as I didn't want to be the only one fighting you and Austria. But if you look at their moves, we haven't really done any work together. We haven't even communicated in years. If you look at what they have done so far, you'll see that they are a.) a very bad player or/and b.) are not at all committed to the game. They have basically communicated with nobody, haven't really attacked anyone, and had a good amount of invalid orders. At this point it doesn't make any sense for me to communicate with Italy, since they are a bad player and are going downhill fast. An alliance with you would be much better."", ""If what you say about you and Austria not having an alliance anymore is true, then it looks like you don't have any friends at all close to you. And I know you're feeling very strong right now, but you will lose all of that if you don't have a powerful alliance. We are both strong countries, and a war would basically mean both of us getting put out of the game"", ""For the record, I don't think you can hold off me, Austria, and Italy at the same time. Definitely not. And although I have no interest in an alliance with Austria, they will be my second option if you continue to be this bellicose."", 'Also can you read? I never suggested Sev to Arm, nor did I ever say I would support you into Rum. Make sure you get the facts straight before you go on a rant like that.', ""And one last thing. If everything happened like I said we should do it, you would have 8; 6 + 1(serbia) + 1(greece) + 1(bulgaria) -1(sev). But that doesn't mean I only get one. Have you noticed my units in Munich and Silesia by any chance? I think you were overreacting."", 'So, I\'m still up for an alliance. I think it would be in both of our best interests, and could be very powerful"" But you need to stop constantly saying shit like""oh we never really worked it out"" or ""oh, I\'m sorry it was too close to the adjudication period"", and then completely running over my ideas as soon as I say them. Sure, they weren\'t 100% ideal, or truthful. But we can talk, and work out the kinks instead of you going on this rant about how bad and unrealistic the plans are.', ""I know you didn't say anything about sev to arm, that's your army I'm talking about having the potential to move there but more likely you just attack rum. And yeah I meant your offer to support me into bud not rum. That's what you said you would do but I can't beleive you would do that so don't include  it in the offer."", 'ok, probably true', ""But you can't know that lol"", 'So ummm.... do you want to try to make something worK?', 'Sure', 'Watch me trust you and get burnt. Looking forward to it', ""I'll back off and attack Italy and you attack austria"", ""Can't give up sev though but you'll probably be able to take it anyway."", 'Lol actually I was thinking ""watch me you and get burnt""', 'Great minds think allike I gues', 'So what are our short term plans? I still strongly think you should take Serbia', ""Also, just letting you know, I'm telling austria that I'm going to attack you and that I want to make an alliance to attack you, just thought I would let you know.

Good luck with that one 🙂 We had a chance vs France but you and Austria don't. I'll have the black sea this year and i'll be the Turkish Turtle for the rest of the game 👍"", ""LOL. Some of you're own medicine turkey. I just can't believe how many times you said you would do something and then you didn't... Why would me and you have a better chance against france than me and austria?  And havn't you noticed my alliance... Well, good luck turkey.

I wanted to put that on the table as a way to get 3 units on Belgium. If Germany plays his cards correctly there is a high chance I lose Ruhr, and that will make it hard to take Belgium. Again, I know it's a huge ask, so right now I'm sending MAO south unless you allow me to put it in the channel temporarily.
