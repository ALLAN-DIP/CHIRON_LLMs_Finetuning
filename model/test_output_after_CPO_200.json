This lack of awareness could lead to FRANCE making decisions that are not in line with their true interests.\n\nSecondly, the message contains a threat, with the statement \"If you support Budapest to hold with Serbia and Turkey cuts Rumania, you'll keep Budapest: otherwise you probably will lose it to Russia\". This threat suggests that FRANCE may be willing to take aggressive action against Budapest if their proposal is not accepted, which could be a sign of FRANCE's true intentions.\n\nFinally, the recommendation from Cicero to support ADR's attack on SER is contradictory to FRANCE's message, which could indicate that FRANCE may be trying to manipulate the situation to suit their own interests.\n\nBased on these factors, it is difficult to fully trust the last message from FRANCE, and it is important to approach"

While the message seems to offer potential support and coordination with Austria, there are several red flags that suggest otherwise.\n\nFirstly, the message mentions pushing into UKR and MOS, which goes against Cicero's recommendation to support UKR's move into MOS. This could indicate that TURKEY is not aligned with Cicero's plans and may have its own agenda.\n\nSecondly, the message mentions supporting Austria into WAR, which could be a potential threat to Russia's safety and stability. It is unusual for a player to willingly support another player into a position that could harm their own allies, and this may indicate that TURKEY is not a reliable partner.\n\nThirdly, the message mentions taking ADR, which is a potential threat to Russia's safety and stability. ADR is a weak position that could be easily attacked by Russia or other players, and TURKEY's desire to take it may indicate a lack of respect for Russia's interests.\n\nFinally, the message does not provide any concrete plans or details, but rather makes vague statements about potential support and coordination.
