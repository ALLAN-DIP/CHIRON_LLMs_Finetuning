Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from ENGLAND? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

As the advisor of AUSTRIA, I must analyze the board status, Cicero recommendations, and the message history to determine whether to trust the last message from ENGLAND.

Based on the board status, AUSTRIA has a strong position in the Mediterranean, with control over the key ports of A VIE and F TRI. The Cicero recommendations suggest that AUSTRIA should focus on maintaining its position in the Mediterranean and expanding its influence in the Balkans.

However, the message history indicates that ENGLAND has recently sent a friendly message to AUSTRIA, which could be a sign of goodwill or a strategic move to gain AUSTRIA's trust. It is important to note that ENGLAND has no direct connections to AUSTRIA's vital centers, which reduces the likelihood of ENGLAND making a move against AUSTRIA.

Taking these factors into consideration, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautiously optimistic about the last message from ENGLAND. While it is possible that ENGLAND may have ulterior motives, the friendly message and lack of direct

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from ENGLAND. The message history is limited to a single message from ENGLAND, which is a generic greeting with no specific context or offer. This lack of detail suggests that ENGLAND may not have any particular interest in coordinating with AUSTRIA at this phase.

Additionally, the Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on defending their existing territories and attacking those of their neighbors, which contradicts the idea of cooperating with ENGLAND.

Overall, the context suggests that ENGLAND may not be a reliable partner for AUSTRIA at this phase, and therefore it is not advisable to trust the last message.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from ENGLAND? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that ENGLAND has been friendly towards AUSTRIA in their messages. The first message simply greets AUSTRIA, while the second message suggests that ENGLAND may have shared interests with AUSTRIA on the eastern half of the map. This could indicate that ENGLAND is interested in forming an alliance or at least has a non-aggressive stance towards AUSTRIA.

However, it is important to note that this is only one message, and it is possible that ENGLAND may have ulterior motives or may change their stance in future messages. Therefore, it is not necessarily safe to blindly trust ENGLAND's last message without further investigation.

As the advisor of AUSTRIA, I would recommend that you proceed with caution and continue to monitor ENGLAND's messages and actions closely before making any decisions based on their last message. It may also be beneficial to consider other factors such as the board status and Cicero's recommendations before making any decisions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from ENGLAND.

The message history between the two players is limited to a single message from ENGLAND expressing a possible shared interest on the eastern half of the map. However, this message lacks specific details or proposals, and Cicero's recommendation for AUSTRIA involves attacking one of ENGLAND's territories (Trieste), which could be seen as a potential threat.

Furthermore, the board status shows that ENGLAND has a strong position in the north with a large army in France and a strong navy, while AUSTRIA is surrounded by enemy territories and has a weak position. Given these factors, it is unlikely that ENGLAND would be willing to share interests with AUSTRIA without demanding something in return.

Therefore, based on the limited message history and the board status, it is not advisable for AUSTRIA to trust the last message from ENGLAND without further clarification or concrete proposals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

As the AI assistant tasked with analyzing the board status, message history, and Cicero recommendations, I must carefully evaluate the situation to determine whether to trust the last message from ENGLAND.

Based on the current board status, AUSTRIA has a strong position in the Mediterranean, with control over the key ports of ATHENS, SALONICA, and VENICE. This gives AUSTRIA a significant advantage in terms of naval power and trade.

However, the message history suggests that ENGLAND is trying to establish a connection with AUSTRIA, which could indicate a potential alliance or at least a desire for cooperation. This is a positive sign, as it may limit the potential for conflict between the two powers.

The Cicero recommendations also support the idea of cooperation, as they suggest that AUSTRIA should focus on building a strong naval presence in the Mediterranean and defending its existing positions.

Taking all of these factors into account, I would advise AUSTRIA to trust the last message from ENGLAND. While it is always important to approach messages with caution, the current situation suggests that EN

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from ENGLAND. The message is simply a friendly greeting, which does not provide any valuable information or indication of ENGLAND's strategic intentions.

The board status shows that AUSTRIA is in a relatively strong position, with a solid hold on the German provinces and a potential opportunity to take Trieste. Cicero's recommendations suggest that AUSTRIA should focus on defending its current positions and taking Trieste, which aligns with AUSTRIA's strategic goals.

In contrast, the message history is blank, indicating that ENGLAND has not provided any significant or informative messages thus far. This lack of communication suggests that ENGLAND may not be a reliable partner or may be hiding its true intentions.

Overall, based on the context provided, it is not advisable to trust the last message from ENGLAND without further information or communication. AUSTRIA should continue to focus on its strategic goals and ignore the friendly greeting for now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, it is challenging to determine whether to trust the last message from ENGLAND. Here are some factors to consider:

1. Context: The message from ENGLAND is quite innocuous and does not contain any suspicious language or hints of aggressive intentions. It simply asks how AUSTRIA is getting along with its neighbors, which is a legitimate question in a diplomatic game like Diplomacy.
2. Recommendations by Cicero: The recommended orders by Cicero for AUSTRIA include a move to Trieste, which could be seen as a potential threat to ENGLAND's interests. However, it is important to note that these recommendations are based on a strategic analysis of the game state, and do not necessarily reflect the true intentions of ENGLAND.
3. Message history: There is no previous history of aggressive or suspicious messages from ENGLAND. In fact, the only message from ENGLAND is a friendly greeting.

Taking these factors into account, it is difficult to make a definitive judgment on whether to trust the last message from ENGLAND. However, it is worth noting

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from ENGLAND. There is no concrete or specific information exchanged between the two players in the message history, and the message seems to be a general inquiry about the relationship between AUSTRIA and its neighbors.

The Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that it should focus on supporting its own units and attacking enemy units, which is a strategic move to gain an advantage on the board. However, the message from ENGLAND does not provide any information that would suggest a potential alliance or collaboration between the two players, which could undermine AUSTRIA's strategic goals.

Additionally, the board status shows that ENGLAND is currently in a favorable position, with several units in good locations and a relatively low number of supplies. This could indicate that ENGLAND may be more likely to attack AUSTRIA if given the opportunity, which could compromise AUSTRIA's position on the board.

Overall, based on the limited information provided, it seems that ENGLAND's message is not worth trusting at this time. AUST

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from ENGLAND. Here's why:

1. Lack of specificity: ENGLAND's message is quite vague, stating only that they are in a "situation." This lack of detail makes it difficult to understand the context and potential implications of their message.
2. Recent history: ENGLAND and AUSTRIA have had a history of rivalry and mistrust in the game. Given this history, it's possible that their message is a ploy to gain an advantage over AUSTRIA.
3. Cicero's recommendations: Cicero's recommendations suggest that AUSTRIA should focus on defending its current positions and avoiding any major moves that could put it at risk. Given this, it would be unwise to trust ENGLAND's message without further investigation.
4. Game state: The current game state shows that AUSTRIA is in a strong position, with a solid control of its territories and a favorable Cicero recommendation. Trusting ENGLAND's message could potentially disrupt this advantage and put AUSTRIA in

Additionally, Cicero's recommendation for AUSTRIA involves attacking ENGLAND's ally, GAL, which could be seen as a potential threat or indication of ENGLAND's intentions.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from ENGLAND? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that ENGLAND is in a difficult position and is trying to downplay their situation. The message "Being caught in the western triangle is not my cup of tea" suggests that ENGLAND is aware of the danger of being surrounded by AUSTRIA, FRANCE, and RUSSIA. However, the message "Things aren't going too poorly" could be interpreted as an attempt to mislead AUSTRIA into thinking that ENGLAND is in a better position than they actually are.

Taking into account the recommendation by Cicero, which suggests that AUSTRIA should focus on gaining control of the Adriatic Sea, it may be wise to be cautious when considering ENGLAND's message. While ENGLAND's message may contain some truth, it is also possible that they are trying to manipulate AUSTRIA into making a decision that benefits ENGLAND.

Based on the current situation and the recommendation by Cicero, it is recommended that AUSTRIA does not trust ENGLAND's last message and should continue to focus on their own objectives.

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that ENGLAND is in a difficult position and is expressing some concerns about being caught in a triangle with AUSTRIA and FRANCE. However, they also mention that things aren't going too poorly, which could suggest that they are trying to downplay their situation.

The Cicero recommendation for AUSTRIA involves attacking AUSTRIA's own territory, which could be seen as a sign that ENGLAND is trying to create a false sense of security. Additionally, the message history between the two players is limited, which could indicate that ENGLAND is not as invested in the game as other players.

Taking all of these factors into account, it is difficult to determine whether to trust the last message from ENGLAND. It is possible that they are trying to manipulate AUSTRIA into a false sense of security, or that they are genuinely trying to downplay their situation.

1. Lack of Context: The message from FRANCE is a generic greeting with no specific context or purpose. It doesn't provide any information that could be used to infer a potential alliance or partnership.
2. Recent History: The message history between the two players is limited, and there is no previous communication that could suggest a trustworthy relationship.
3. Recommendations from Cicero: The recommended orders from Cicero for AUSTRIA suggest that the player should focus on defending their existing territories and expanding into the Balkans, rather than forming an alliance with FRANCE.
4. Board Position: AUSTRIA is in a relatively strong position on the board, with control over several key territories and a favorable position in the Balkans. It may be more beneficial to focus on consolidating their position rather than forming an alliance with a player that has a limited track record of trustworthiness.

In conclusion, based on the information provided, it is unlikely that AUSTRIA should trust the last message

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from FRANCE. The message is a generic greeting with no specific context or offer, which raises suspicions. Additionally, the Cicero recommendations suggest that FRANCE is focused on its own interests and is not offering any particularly advantageous moves for AUSTRIA.

The board status also indicates that FRANCE is in a favorable position, with a strong army in the North and a good supply of units in the Mediterranean. This suggests that FRANCE may be less likely to cooperate with AUSTRIA, especially given the current phase of the game.

Overall, the lack of specificity in the message and the favorable position of FRANCE on the board suggest that FRANCE may not be a reliable partner for AUSTRIA at this time. It would be best for AUSTRIA to proceed with caution and consider alternative moves that align with its own interests.

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when trusting the last message from FRANCE. While FRANCE's message does seem to be an attempt to gather information and coordinate with AUSTRIA, there are a few red flags that suggest FRANCE may not be acting in good faith.

Firstly, FRANCE's message is vague and open-ended, which could be a tactic to gather information without committing to any specific plan. Additionally, FRANCE's mention of "Italian intentions" could be a distraction from their actual plans, which may involve attacking AUSTRIA or one of its allies.

Furthermore, FRANCE's recommendation to play defensively in AUSTRIA's current position suggests that they may be anticipating an attack from AUSTRIA or one of its allies. This could be a sign that FRANCE is planning to attack AUSTRIA in the near future.

Considering these factors, it would be wise for AUSTRIA to approach FRANCE's message with caution and to gather more information before making any decisions based on FRANCE'

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Lack of specific information: The message from FRANCE is quite general, asking about Italian intentions without providing any specific information or context. This makes it difficult to determine the purpose of the message and whether it is genuine or not.
2. Inconsistent tone: The message from FRANCE is friendly and casual, which could be an indication that FRANCE is trying to hide its true intentions. In a game of Diplomacy, it is important to be cautious of friendly-sounding messages, especially when they are not backed up by concrete information.
3. Contradictory recommendation: Cicero's recommendation for AUSTRIA is to focus on defensive moves, which suggests that FRANCE may have a different strategy in mind. It is unlikely that FRANCE would be genuinely concerned about Italian intentions if it were planning to attack AUSTRIA.

Taking these factors into account, it seems unlikely that the last message from FRANCE is genuine and should be trusted. AUSTRIA

Prediction before CPO:  As the advisor of AUSTRIA, based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. Here are some points to consider:

1. FRANCE is expressing interest in Italy's intentions, which could be a genuine attempt to gather information or a ploy to manipulate AUSTRIA's moves.
2. The message from FRANCE suggests that AUSTRIA may be planning to play defensively, which could be a strategic move to avoid being drawn into a war with ITALY.

Considering these points, it is difficult to make a definitive judgment on whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. However, here are some possible courses of action:

1. AUSTRIA could choose to ignore the message and focus on its own moves, considering the potential risks and benefits of each action.
2. AUSTRIA could respond to the message, expressing its own concerns and interests, and potentially setting

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE.

The message history between the two players suggests that FRANCE is trying to gather information about Italy's intentions, which could be a potential move to create an alliance or to position itself for a better strategic position. By asking about Italy's intentions, FRANCE is demonstrating an interest in the game and a willingness to coordinate with AUSTRIA.

However, the Cicero recommendation for AUSTRIA suggests that it should focus on defensive moves, which could be a conflicting signal. If FRANCE is truly interested in coordinating with AUSTRIA, it would be more likely to suggest offensive moves that would benefit both players.

Additionally, the fact that FRANCE is asking about Italy's intentions and AUSTRIA has not yet heard anything from Italy could indicate that FRANCE is trying to create an opportunity for itself.

Overall, based on the message history and the Cicero recommendation, it seems that FRANCE may be trying to create an opportunity for itself, which could be a potential threat to AUSTRIA's interests. Therefore, it is not advisable

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE is trying to gather information from AUSTRIA about Italy's intentions and is also expressing a desire to secure their own borders. The last message from FRANCE, which asks about AUSTRIA's thoughts on their moves, suggests that they are interested in coordinating with AUSTRIA.

However, there are some red flags in the message history that could indicate that FRANCE may not be trustworthy. Firstly, the initial message from FRANCE asking about Italy's intentions could be seen as a probe to gather information that could be used against AUSTRIA. Secondly, the fact that FRANCE is not directly addressing AUSTRIA's concerns about Italy's moves, but rather asking about AUSTRIA's own moves, could indicate that they are not interested in a genuine alliance.

2. FRANCE's message history with AUSTRIA is limited, which could suggest that they are not as invested in the game as other players.
3. FRANCE's recommendation to AUSTRIA is to attack GAL, which could be seen as a potential threat or an attempt to distract AUSTRIA from their own plans.

Taking these factors into account, it is difficult to determine whether AUSTRIA should trust the last message from FRANCE. It is possible that FRANCE is genuinely trying to work together with AUSTRIA, but it is also possible that they are trying to manipulate them for their own gain.

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise caution when trusting the last message from FRANCE. While FRANCE's recommendation to attack TRIeste with Austria is strategically sound, there is no context provided to explain why they are asking what Austria is thinking now. This lack of context raises suspicions about FRANCE's true intentions. 

It's possible that FRANCE is trying to gather information about Austria's plans or is attempting to distract Austria from their true intentions. Therefore, it's advisable to approach this message with caution and consider other options before making any decisions based solely on FRANCE's recommendation.

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when deciding whether to trust the last message from FRANCE.

The board status shows that FRANCE has a strong position in the Mediterranean, with two units in Marseille and one in Nice, which could potentially threaten AUSTRIA's own units in the region. Additionally, the Cicero recommendation for AUSTRIA involves attacking Trieste, which is a key port for AUSTRIA and could be a potential target for FRANCE.

The message history also suggests that FRANCE is interested in AUSTRIA's plans, which could indicate that they are planning to attack or counter-attack. However, it is also possible that FRANCE is simply trying to gather information to make a more informed decision.

Taking into account these factors, it is difficult to determine whether FRANCE's message is genuine or not. Therefore, AUSTRIA should be cautious when deciding whether to trust the message and should consider all available information before making a decision.

In summary, based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when dec

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious about trusting the last message from FRANCE. While FRANCE's message expresses a desire to work together, there are several red flags that suggest FRANCE may not be genuine in their intentions.

Firstly, FRANCE's message is vague and open-ended, lacking any specific proposals or actions. This lack of detail raises suspicions about FRANCE's commitment to cooperation.

Secondly, FRANCE's message references working with Italy/Russia/Turkey, which are all countries that have historically been at odds with AUSTRIA. This could suggest that FRANCE is trying to position themselves as a mediator or broker between these countries, potentially at AUSTRIA's expense.

Lastly, the fact that FRANCE's messages are directed at AUSTRIA specifically, rather than addressing the broader diplomatic situation, suggests that FRANCE may be trying to isolate AUSTRIA and create a power vacuum.

In light of these factors, it is advisable for AUSTRIA to

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from FRANCE. The message history between the two players is limited, and FRANCE's message does not provide any specific or concrete information that would indicate their intentions or preferences.

The Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on defending their northern border and supporting Italy in the Adriatic, which aligns with their current position on A VIE and F TRI. However, FRANCE's message does not offer any specific proposal or recommendation that would suggest they are willing to work together or coordinate their actions.

Furthermore, the board status shows that FRANCE has a strong position in the Mediterranean with F NWG, F NTH, and A LVP, which could potentially be used to attack AUSTRIA's southern border. This could be a sign that FRANCE may not be as willing to work together as their message suggests.

In conclusion, based on the limited message history and the current board status, it is not advisable for AUSTRIA to trust the last message from FRANCE.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

As an AI assistant, I can analyze the board status, Cicero recommendations, and message history to provide feedback on whether to trust the last message from FRANCE.

Based on the board status, AUSTRIA has a strong position in the Mediterranean with a fleet in the Black Sea and control over the Bosphorus. The Cicero recommendations suggest that AUSTRIA should focus on maintaining control over the Balkans and the Mediterranean.

The message history is limited, with only one message from FRANCE, which simply states "Very interesting moves." This message does not provide any specific information that could be used to determine FRANCE's intentions.

Taking these factors into account, it is difficult to determine whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. While it is possible that FRANCE is trying to signal their intentions or negotiate with AUSTRIA, the lack of context and specific information makes it difficult to make a definitive judgment.

As the advisor of AUSTRIA, I would recommend caution and a wait-and-see approach before making any decisions based on the last message from FRANCE. It may be beneficial

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from FRANCE. The message "Very interesting moves" could be a generic message that does not provide any concrete information or a hint about FRANCE's true intentions. Additionally, the Cicero recommendation for AUSTRIA suggests that they should focus on defending their existing territories and not necessarily trust any messages from FRANCE.

The board status also suggests that there is a power vacuum in the Mediterranean, with multiple powers vying for control. FRANCE's message could be an attempt to gauge AUSTRIA's intentions or to create a false sense of security.

In summary, without any concrete information or a clear indication of FRANCE's true intentions, it is best for AUSTRIA to be cautious and not trust the last message from FRANCE.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE and AUSTRIA have had a positive exchange of messages, with FRANCE complimenting AUSTRIA on their strategic moves and AUSTRIA expressing interest in potential alliances. However, the message from FRANCE also mentions that they have no chance of keeping Munich and are in a less than ideal situation, which could potentially be a red flag.

It is important to note that in Diplomacy, messages can often be misleading or intentionally deceptive, so it is crucial to approach them with caution. While the positive tone of the messages between FRANCE and AUSTRIA is encouraging, it is still unclear what FRANCE's true intentions are.

Taking into account the recommended orders by Cicero, which suggest that AUSTRIA should focus on building in Trieste and attacking Albania, it may be beneficial to proceed with caution and not fully trust FRANCE's last message. It is possible that FRANCE is trying to manipulate AUSTRIA into a false sense of security, potentially leading to a disadvantageous position in the game.

Therefore, as the

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Lack of Alignment: The message history between the two players is limited, and there is no indication of any prior agreements or alignments between them. FRANCE's message expressing interest in keeping Munich and England being in the channel suggests that they may be looking to gain an advantage over AUSTRIA.
2. Inconsistent Tone: FRANCE's message expressing interest in keeping Munich and England being in the channel is inconsistent with their recommendation to take Trieste, which is a move that would put AUSTRIA in a difficult position.
3. Lack of Clarity: The message from FRANCE is vague and lacks clarity, making it difficult to determine their true intentions.

Considering these factors, it is unlikely that FRANCE's message is genuine and AUSTRIA should be cautious in trusting it. It is important to continue monitoring the situation and gathering more information before making any decisions.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE and AUSTRIA have had a cordial and cooperative relationship so far in the game. FRANCE has acknowledged AUSTRIA's impressive builds and inquired about any alliances, showing interest in maintaining a positive relationship.

However, there are some red flags in the message history that could indicate FRANCE may not be trustworthy. FRANCE mentions that they have "no chance of keeping Munich" and that Germany may attack them, which could suggest that FRANCE is planning to defect or is in a vulnerable position.

Taking into account the Cicero recommendations, which suggest that AUSTRIA should focus on building in the Balkans and the Mediterranean, it may be beneficial to maintain a cautious approach towards FRANCE. While it is possible that FRANCE may have legitimate reasons for their actions, it is also possible that they may be trying to manipulate AUSTRIA for their own gain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE and AUSTRIA have a relatively positive message history, with FRANCE expressing interest in working together and AUSTRIA asking about potential alliances. However, there are some red flags that suggest FRANCE may not be trustworthy.

Firstly, FRANCE's recommendation to AUSTRIA to attack TRIESTE and GREEN seems counterproductive, as it could lead to a conflict between the two players. Additionally, FRANCE's statement that they have "no chance of keeping Munich" and are in a "less than ideal situation" could be seen as an attempt to manipulate AUSTRIA into making a move that benefits FRANCE.

Furthermore, the Cicero recommendation for AUSTRIA to attack TRIESTE and GREEN is not aligned with FRANCE's message, which could indicate that FRANCE is trying to mislead AUSTRIA.

Based on these factors, it is not advisable for AUSTRIA to trust the last message from FRANCE. It is important for AUSTRIA to carefully consider its options and evaluate the potential risks and benefits

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when trusting the last message from FRANCE. The message from FRANCE seems to be trying to gather information and assess AUSTRIA's relationship with Turkey, which could be a potential threat to FRANCE's interests in the region.

The message from FRANCE mentions that AUSTRIA and Turkey were "buddies," which could be a subtle attempt to undermine AUSTRIA's alliance with Turkey. Additionally, the mention of "unfortunate" in AUSTRIA's message could be a reference to a recent event or development that FRANCE is not aware of, which could be a reason for FRANCE to be suspicious of AUSTRIA's actions.

Furthermore, the recommendation from Cicero to attack Galicia suggests that FRANCE may have ulterior motives in the region, which could be at odds with AUSTRIA's interests. Therefore, it is important for AUSTRIA to exercise caution when evaluating FRANCE's message and to consider alternative interpretations of the situation.

In conclusion, while the message

1. Lack of specific details: The message from FRANCE is quite general and lacks specific details about the situation in AUSTRIA's region. It is not clear what specifically is causing concern or why FRANCE is reaching out to AUSTRIA.
2. Suspicious timing: The message is sent after Cicero recommends attacking A BUD, which could be seen as an attempt to manipulate AUSTRIA's decision-making.
3. Past history: FRANCE and Turkey have a history of working together, as evidenced by their recent moves in the region. It is possible that FRANCE is trying to create an opportunity to attack AUSTRIA while it is vulnerable.
4. Cicero's recommendation: Cicero recommends attacking A BUD, which is the same move that FRANCE is suggesting. This could be seen as a sign that FRANCE is trying to manipulate AUSTRIA into making a move that would be beneficial to FRANCE.

They simply express their worry about a potential alliance between Russia and Turkey, without offering any evidence or suggestions on how to address the issue.
2. Inconsistent messaging: FRANCE's message history with AUSTRIA shows a mix of friendly and suspicious tones. They initially greet AUSTRIA as a "buddy," but later express worry about a potential alliance with Russia. This inconsistency suggests that FRANCE may not have a clear strategy or agenda, which makes it difficult to determine whether they can be trusted.
3. Self-interest: FRANCE's message focuses primarily on their own regional security concerns, without offering any tangible support or assistance to AUSTRIA.

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that there is a lack of trust between AUSTRIA and FRANCE, with both players expressing concerns about each other's actions and intentions. The last message from FRANCE suggests that they are worried about a potential alliance between RUSSIA and TURKEY, and are questioning AUSTRIA's trustworthiness.

However, there are some mitigating factors to consider. Firstly, the recommendation from Cicero to attack A VIE and GAL suggests that AUSTRIA has a strategic interest in these territories, which could indicate that they are not planning to betray their ally. Secondly, the message from AUSTRIA expressing concern about a potential alliance between RUSSIA and TURKEY suggests that they are aware of the potential threat and are taking steps to protect themselves.

Taking these factors into account, it is difficult to make a definitive decision on whether to trust the last message from FRANCE.

However, there are some red flags that suggest FRANCE may not be trustworthy:

1. FRANCE expressed concern about a potential Russia-Turkey alliance, which aligns with AUSTRIA's own concerns. This could indicate that FRANCE is looking out for AUSTRIA's interests and is willing to share information that could help protect them.
2. FRANCE questioned the logic of Russia's build in Warsaw, which could suggest that they are genuinely trying to understand the situation and provide helpful insights.
3.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been consistently expressing concerns about a potential alliance between RUSSIA and TURKEY, and has been questioning AUSTRIA's moves in the region. However, there are some inconsistencies in FRANCE's messages that could make it difficult to determine whether to trust them.

Firstly, FRANCE initially expresses worry about a "steamroller/Russia Turkey alliance", but then seems to suggest that AUSTRIA and FRANCE could be working together to take Sevastopol. This could indicate that FRANCE is not necessarily opposed to an alliance between AUSTRIA and RUSSIA, but rather wants to maintain a close relationship with AUSTRIA in order to have a better chance of taking Sevastopol.

Secondly, FRANCE's messages suggest that they are trying to gather information about AUSTRIA's plans, particularly regarding the convoy to Tunis. This could indicate that FRANCE is trying to assess whether AUSTRIA is a potential threat or an ally, rather than simply trying to manipulate them.

Overall, it is difficult to determine whether to trust

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been communicating with AUSTRIA regarding their concerns about a potential alliance between Russia and Turkey, and the potential danger of a steamroller/Russia-Turkey alliance. FRANCE has also expressed their suspicions about Italy's moves and whether they are planning to convoy Venice to Tunis.

In terms of the Cicero recommendations, they suggest that AUSTRIA should focus on defending its borders and supporting Italy in the Mediterranean. The recommendations also suggest that AUSTRIA should be cautious of Russia's moves and try to prevent Russia from taking Romania.

Considering the message history between FRANCE and AUSTRIA, it seems that they have a good rapport and are communicating openly about their concerns. FRANCE has expressed its concerns about a potential alliance between Russia and Turkey, and AUSTRIA has also expressed similar concerns.

Based on this information, it seems that FRANCE is a trustworthy partner for AUSTRIA, and it may be beneficial for AUSTRIA to continue communicating with FRANCE and sharing its concerns. However, it

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: . Based on the provided information, I cannot give a definitive answer to whether AUSTRIA should trust FRANCE's last message. However, I can analyze the context and provide some insights that may help inform the decision.

FRANCE has a history of being a challenging partner for AUSTRIA, and their messages do not necessarily convey trust or cooperation. They have expressed concerns about a potential alliance between RUSSIA and TURKEY, which could impact AUSTRIA's position in the region.

On the other hand, FRANCE has also provided some helpful insights into the region's dynamics, such as their observations about the potential motivations behind RUSSIA's moves in Warsaw and Sevastopol. They have also shown interest in AUSTRIA's plans for Venice and Tunis, which could indicate a willingness to collaborate.

Ultimately, the decision to trust FRANCE's last message depends on AUSTRIA's specific goals and priorities. If AUSTRIA values cooperation with FRANCE and wants to maintain a positive relationship, they may choose to trust FRANCE's message. However, if AUST

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: , based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Lack of specificity: The message from FRANCE is quite general and doesn't provide any concrete information that could be trusted. It simply expresses concerns about a potential Russia-Turkey alliance and mentions that FRANCE is worried about a steamroller/Russia Turkey alliance.
2. Inconsistent tone: The message history between the two players shows that FRANCE has been sending mixed signals. In one message, FRANCE expresses concern about AUSTRIA's moves, but in the next message, they seem to be trying to downplay the situation. This inconsistency makes it difficult to determine the true intentions of FRANCE.
3. Lack of concrete evidence: While FRANCE has mentioned several times that they are concerned about a potential Russia-Turkey alliance, they have not provided any concrete evidence to support their claims. Without any specific information or context, it is difficult to determine the likelihood of such an alliance.
4. Suspicious timing: The message history also shows that FRANCE has been trying to gather

Prediction before CPO: ,As the AI assistant, I have analyzed the board status, message history, and Cicero recommendations provided, and I will offer my feedback on whether to trust the last message from FRANCE.

Based on the message history, there are some red flags that suggest FRANCE may not be trustworthy:

1. FRANCE's initial message expresses concern about a potential steamroller/Russia-Turkey alliance, but then FRANCE suggests building A Smyrna to capture Armenia and Sevastopol, which could be seen as contradictory.
2. FRANCE's subsequent messages show a lack of understanding of AUSTRIA's moves, such as not realizing that AUSTRIA's builds in Serbia were meant to counter FRANCE's builds in Bulgaria.
3. FRANCE's messages also reveal a lack of coordination with AUSTRIA, such as not knowing about AUSTRIA's plan to convoy Venice to Tunis.

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the provided information, it seems that FRANCE has been communicating with AUSTRIA in a cautious and informative manner, sharing their observations and concerns about the current situation. However, there are some red flags that suggest FRANCE may not be fully trustworthy.

Firstly, FRANCE has been expressing concerns about a potential alliance between RUSSIA and TURKEY, which could pose a threat to AUSTRIA's interests. While this is certainly a valid concern, it's worth noting that FRANCE has not provided any concrete evidence to support their claims.

Secondly, FRANCE has been suggesting that AUSTRIA should be cautious of AUSTRIA's moves in the north, particularly in relation to GERMANY and ENGLAND. While it's true that AUSTRIA's army could be needed in Albania, it's also important to consider the potential benefits of maintaining a strong presence in the north.

Thirdly, FRANCE has been sharing their own plans and intentions with AUSTRIA, which could be seen as a sign of trust or a calculated move to gain leverage. However,

When analyzing the message history, it appears that FRANCE has been trying to gather information and gauge AUSTRIA's intentions, with a focus on the potential threat posed by Russia and Turkey. FRANCE has expressed concerns about a possible steamroller/Russia-Turkey alliance and has suggested that AUSTRIA should take Galicia and Belgium to counter this threat.

However, there are some red flags that suggest AUSTRIA should not fully trust FRANCE's last message:

1. Lack of specific details: While FRANCE has been sharing their thoughts and ideas with AUSTRIA, they have not provided any specific details or concrete evidence to support their claims.

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been consistently expressing concerns about a potential alliance between RUSSIA and TURKEY, and has been trying to gather information and assess the situation. FRANCE has also been offering advice and suggestions to AUSTRIA on how to handle the situation.

However, there are some red flags that suggest AUSTRIA should not fully trust FRANCE's last message:

1. FRANCE has been inconsistent in its messages, sometimes expressing concerns about a potential alliance and other times seeming to dismiss them. This lack of consistency makes it difficult to determine the accuracy of FRANCE's claims.
2. FRANCE has been focusing on the potential alliance between RUSSIA and TURKEY, but has not provided any concrete evidence to support its claims. This lack of evidence makes it difficult to trust FRANCE's assessment.
3. FRANCE has been suggesting that AUSTRIA should be cautious of RUSSIA and TURKEY, but has not provided any suggestions on how AUSTRIA can protect itself from these potential threats. This lack of actionable advice makes it difficult to trust FR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE and AUSTRIA have a history of exchanging messages in Diplomacy, with both players expressing concerns and suspicions about each other's moves. The recommendation by Cicero for AUSTRIA to attack GAL and ION, as well as the discussion of Russia and Turkey's potential alliance, suggest that FRANCE may be trying to manipulate or deceive AUSTRIA.

The message history also reveals that FRANCE has been expressing concerns about Russia's moves and Turkey's intentions, which could be a sign that FRANCE is trying to create a false narrative or distrust towards AUSTRIA. Additionally, the message from FRANCE about not telling anyone about Italy's moves could be seen as an attempt to create a false sense of security or loyalty between the two players.

Taking all of these factors into account, it is difficult to determine whether to fully trust the last message from FRANCE. While it is possible that FRANCE may be genuinely expressing concerns about Russia's moves, the context of the message history and the recommendation by Cicero suggest that FRANCE may be trying to manipulate or dece

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise AUSTRIA to distrust the last message from FRANCE. Here's why:

1. Lack of specificity: The message from FRANCE is quite vague, merely stating that AUSTRIA "needs a build this turn." It does not provide any specific information about what kind of build is needed or why.
2. Inconsistency with previous messages: FRANCE has not been consistent in its messages to AUSTRIA. Earlier in the game, it recommended that AUSTRIA build in A BUD, which is not aligned with its current message.
3. Potential for manipulation: FRANCE's message could be an attempt to manipulate AUSTRIA into making a particular move that benefits FRANCE.
4. Contrary to Cicero's recommendations: Cicero's recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest building in A VIE and A BUD, which are not aligned with the message from FRANCE.

In light of these factors, it is advisable for AUSTRIA to exercise caution when considering FRANCE's message and to prioritize its own strategic goals rather

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from FRANCE. Here's why:

1. Cicero's recommendations: Cicero has recommended attacking AUSTRIA's own unit in Belgium, which goes against the principle of not attacking a unit that is supporting another of your own units.
2. Board status: The board status shows that AUSTRIA has a strong position in Belgium, with two units supporting each other. Attacking one of these units would weaken AUSTRIA's position and make it more vulnerable to future attacks.
3. Message history: The message from FRANCE does not provide any specific reasons or justifications for why AUSTRIA should attack Belgium. It simply states that AUSTRIA needs a build this turn, which could be a generic message or a distraction tactic.

Overall, based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE is trying to distract AUSTRIA from its strong position in Belgium and manipulate it into attacking a unit that is crucial to its own safety. Therefore, it is not advisable to trust the last message

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when deciding whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. While FRANCE's recommendations for AUSTRIA's build orders are consistent with their usual alliance-oriented playstyle, the message containing the phrase "Whatever you do, don't let Turkey take Greece AND Sevastopol" could potentially be a red flag.

Turkey has been known to aggressively pursue its objectives in the game, and it's possible that FRANCE is trying to manipulate AUSTRIA into making a move that would benefit FRANCE's own interests. Additionally, the message's emphasis on Sevastopol, which is a key port for both FRANCE and RUSSIA, suggests that FRANCE may be trying to position AUSTRIA to take a fall for them.

On the other hand, FRANCE has consistently provided helpful advice to AUSTRIA throughout the game, and their recommendations align with AUSTRIA's own interests. Furthermore, AUSTRIA and FRANCE have a strong alliance, and it's possible that FRANCE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to exercise caution when deciding whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. While FRANCE's recommendation to attack Greece and Sevastopol may seem beneficial, the message history suggests that FRANCE is trying to manipulate AUSTRIA's actions.

The first message from FRANCE about needing a build this turn could be a genuine request for assistance, but it could also be a ploy to distract AUSTRIA from FRANCE's true intentions. The second message, warning AUSTRIA against allowing Turkey to take Greece and Sevastopol, could be a attempt to create a false sense of security and make AUSTRIA more likely to trust FRANCE's recommendations.

Additionally, the Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that FRANCE may be trying to direct AUSTRIA's actions towards a specific outcome. By recommending attacks on Greece and Sevastopol, FRANCE may be trying to create a strategic advantage for itself.

In conclusion, while FRANCE's recommendations may seem beneficial, the message history and Cicero recommendations suggest

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious about trusting the last message from FRANCE. While FRANCE has provided some useful information and advice, there are some red flags that suggest FRANCE may not be acting in AUSTRIA's best interests.

Firstly, FRANCE's recommendation to build in AUSTRIA's home centers (Austria, Serbia, and Budapest) is not in AUSTRIA's best interest, as it would weaken AUSTRIA's position in the long run. AUSTRIA should prioritize building in its home centers to ensure its survival and security.

Secondly, FRANCE's warning against letting Turkey take Greece and Sevastopol is suspicious. While it is true that Turkey is a powerful player in the game, FRANCE's sudden concern for AUSTRIA's safety suggests that FRANCE may have ulterior motives. AUSTRIA should be cautious of FRANCE's intentions and not take FRANCE's advice at face value.

Lastly, FRANCE's repeated inquiries about A

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Inconsistent messages: FRANCE has been inconsistent in its messages, with one message urging AUSTRIA to take Greece and another warning against it. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to determine FRANCE's true intentions.
2. Lack of specificity: The messages from FRANCE are not specific or detailed enough to provide clear guidance on how AUSTRIA should proceed.
3. Contradictory advice: FRANCE's recommendation to take Galicia and Albany, while also warning against letting Turkey take Greece, creates a conflicting situation that makes it difficult to determine the best course of action.

Considering the current board status and Cicero's recommendations, it seems that FRANCE's messages are not providing valuable or reliable advice. AUSTRIA should be cautious when considering FRANCE's recommendations and should instead focus on its own strategic goals and Cicero's recommendations.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, it appears that FRANCE has been trying to convey important information to AUSTRIA regarding Turkey's intentions and actions. However, there are some red flags that suggest FRANCE's messages may not be entirely trustworthy.

Firstly, FRANCE's initial message urges AUSTRIA to build in a particular way, which could be a veiled attempt to manipulate AUSTRIA's strategy. While it is understandable that FRANCE would want to influence AUSTRIA's decisions, it is important to consider the potential motivations behind such messages.

Secondly, FRANCE's message about Turkey's alleged collusion with Russia and AUSTRIA is concerning. While it is possible that Russia and AUSTRIA may have had a misunderstanding, the fact that FRANCE is bringing it up suggests that they may have ulterior motives.

Lastly, FRANCE's message about Turkey's supposed manipulation of both Russia and AUSTRIA is suspicious. It is possible that FRANCE is trying to create a narrative that would justify their own actions or to sow discord between AUSTRIA and

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Inconsistent messages: FRANCE has been sending mixed signals regarding their intentions towards AUSTRIA. They mention needing a build this turn, but also express concerns about Turkey taking Greece and Sevastopol, which could be seen as an attempt to manipulate AUSTRIA's actions.
2. Lack of specificity: FRANCE's messages do not provide clear or specific advice on how to proceed. They ask for updates on AUSTRIA's plans regarding Turkey, but do not offer any concrete suggestions or recommendations.
3. History of mistrust: The message history between FRANCE and AUSTRIA indicates that they do not have a strong history of trust. FRANCE has expressed concerns about AUSTRIA's intentions and has questioned their loyalty, which suggests that they may not be reliable partners.
4. Contradictory recommendations: Cicero's recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on supporting Italy and taking Smyrna, which is the opposite of what FRANCE

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  As the AI assistant tasked with analyzing the board status, message history, and Cicero recommendations, I must carefully evaluate the information provided to determine whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. Here's my analysis:

1. Board status: The board status indicates that AUSTRIA has a strong position in the Adriatic, with a fleet in the Black Sea and a build in the Aegean. This gives AUSTRIA a good chance of controlling Greece and the Bosphorus, which aligns with FRANCE's recommendations.
2. Message history: FRANCE has been communicating with AUSTRIA consistently throughout the game, providing valuable insights and advice. However, there are some red flags in the message history:

a. FRANCE warned AUSTRIA against letting Turkey take Greece and Sevastopol, which could suggest that FRANCE is trying to create a false sense of security or manipulate AUSTRIA's actions.

b. FRANCE mentioned that Russia told them that Russia was working with AUSTRIA against Turkey, but then Turkey convinced both FRANCE and Russia to work with them. This could indicate that FRANCE is not fully trust

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been consistently expressing concerns about Turkey's intentions and actions in the game. FRANCE has mentioned multiple times that Turkey is playing both sides and that Russia has been working with FRANCE against Turkey in the first year. Additionally, FRANCE has suggested that AUSTRIA should be cautious about letting Turkey take Greece and Sevastopol.

However, there are some inconsistencies in FRANCE's messages that could indicate a lack of trustworthiness. For example, FRANCE initially mentions that Russia is working with AUSTRIA against Turkey, but then later mentions that Russia has been working with Turkey. This could suggest that FRANCE is not entirely sure of Russia's intentions or is trying to manipulate AUSTRIA's actions.

Taking into account the context of the game and the recommended orders by Cicero, it seems that FRANCE is trying to convey valuable information about Turkey's potential actions and AUSTRIA's best interests. However, due to the inconsistencies in FRANCE's messages, it is difficult to fully trust FRANCE's recommendations.

Therefore, based on the information provided,

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: . As the advisor of AUSTRIA, I understand that you are considering whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. Based on the board status and the message history between the two players, I will provide my analysis and feedback.

Firstly, the board status shows that AUSTRIA has a strong position in the Balkans, with a majority of its armies in the region. Additionally, the recommended orders by Cicero suggest that AUSTRIA should focus on building in the Balkans and taking Galicia from RUSSIA. This aligns with the message history between FRANCE and AUSTRIA, where FRANCE has expressed concerns about Turkey's growth and urged AUSTRIA to take action in the Balkans.

However, there are some red flags in the message history that suggest FRANCE may not be entirely trustworthy. FRANCE has mentioned that Russia told them that it was working with AUSTRIA against Turkey, but when the orders were read, Turkey had convinced both AUSTRIA and Russia to work with it. This could indicate that FRANCE is trying to manipulate AUSTRIA into a false sense of security.

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. FRANCE has been consistently communicative and forthcoming with their intentions, but their messages also contain some contradictory or suspicious elements. For instance, they mention not wanting Turkey to take Greece AND Sevastopol, but then also express concern about Turkey growing explosively and wiping out half of the map. This could be seen as a tactic to gain leverage or control over AUSTRIA's actions.
2. The recommendation from Cicero to attack Aegean with Aegean fleet and to attack Galatians with Galatians fleet could be seen as a potential threat to AUSTRIA's interests. By attacking Galatians, FRANCE could potentially weaken AUSTRIA's position in the region and create an opportunity for themselves.
3. The message history between the two players also suggests that FRANCE may not be fully trustworthy. They have expressed concern about Turkey's intentions, but they have also been relatively quiet about their own plans and motivations. This lack of transpar

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, it is challenging to determine whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. However, there are some red flags that suggest caution is warranted.

Firstly, FRANCE has been quite active in the message history, which could indicate a potential bias or ulterior motive. FRANCE's repeated concerns about Turkey's growing power and its potential to wipe out half of the map may be genuine, but they could also be a ploy to manipulate AUSTRIA's actions.

Secondly, FRANCE's suggestion that Russia won't work with AUSTRIA on recapturing Rumania from Turkey raises suspicions. If FRANCE knew that Russia wouldn't work with AUSTRIA, why would they bring it up in their message? It could be a ploy to distract AUSTRIA from their primary objective or to create tension between AUSTRIA and Russia.

Thirdly, FRANCE's reference to Russia's previous betrayal of AUSTRIA is concerning. If FRANCE is aware of this history, they should be cautious about trusting Russia's intentions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from FRANCE. There are several red flags in the message history that suggest FRANCE may be trying to manipulate or deceive AUSTRIA.

1. FRANCE mentions that Russia told them that AUSTRIA is working against Turkey, but then Russia refused to work with AUSTRIA on recapturing Rumania. This inconsistency raises suspicions about FRANCE's true intentions.
2. FRANCE repeatedly expresses concern about Turkey's growth and AUSTRIA's plans, but their messages could be seen as an attempt to distract or deflect attention from their own actions.
3. FRANCE's recommendation to focus on Galicia and the Balkans aligns with their own interests but may not be in AUSTRIA's best interests.

In light of these factors, it is unlikely that FRANCE is providing genuine and trustworthy advice. AUSTRIA should proceed with caution and consider alternative sources of advice before making decisions based on FRANCE's recommendations.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been actively communicating with AUSTRIA and providing valuable insights and advice. FRANCE has expressed concerns about Turkey's growing power and the potential threat it poses to the board, and has offered to help AUSTRIA in recapturing Rumania from Turkey.

FRANCE's recommendation to focus on Galicia and Albion, while also supporting AUSTRIA's build in Buda, seems to be a strategic move to counter Turkey's expansion. Additionally, FRANCE has acknowledged AUSTRIA's limitations in working with Russia, which suggests that FRANCE is willing to work with AUSTRIA independently.

However, there are some red flags that could indicate that FRANCE's messages may not be entirely trustworthy. For example, FRANCE has mentioned that Russia told them that he was working with AUSTRIA against Turkey, but then Turkey convinced both AUSTRIA and Russia to work with them. This could suggest that FRANCE is not entirely sure of Russia's intentions, which could be a cause for concern.

This raises questions about FRANCE's trustworthiness and their ability to provide accurate information.

Additionally, the Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on supporting Italy and taking Greece, which could potentially benefit FRANCE as well. This could be seen as a potential attempt to manipulate AUSTRIA into doing FRANCE's bidding, rather than providing genuine advice.

Overall, while FRANCE has provided some helpful messages, the inconsistencies and potential conflicting interests suggest that AUSTRIA should approach the last message with caution and carefully consider the context before making a decision.

Prediction before CPO: , based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine whether AUSTRIA should trust the last message from FRANCE. There are several conflicting statements and lack of clear evidence that could suggest that FRANCE is being truthful or not. Here are some points to consider:

1. FRANCE is concerned about Turkey's expansion and wants AUSTRIA to work with Russia to recapture Rumania. However, the message from AUSTRIA indicates that Russia is not willing to work with them on this matter. This raises questions about FRANCE's true intentions and whether they are being honest about their motivations.
2. FRANCE has a history of playing both sides, as revealed in the message from FRANCE. This suggests that they may be trying to manipulate AUSTRIA for their own gain, rather than acting in good faith.
3. The message from FRANCE about Russia being MIA for the past few days could be a red flag. If Russia is not responding to AUSTRIA, it could indicate that they are not interested in working with them or that they have other plans in motion.
4. The lack of clear evidence and concrete proposals from FRANCE for how to deal

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: , based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Lack of specific information: The message from FRANCE does not provide any specific or concrete information that could be used to verify its authenticity. It only raises concerns about Turkey's intentions and AUSTRIA's supposed plans with Russia.
2. History of mistrust: The message history between the two players indicates that they have had trouble communicating and trusting each other in the past. FRANCE has expressed concerns about AUSTRIA's plans with Russia and Italy, which could be seen as a lack of trust.
3. Unclear motivations: FRANCE's motivations for sending the message are not entirely clear. While it mentions Turkey's growing power and the importance of keeping Turkey from taking Greece and Sevastopol, it also raises questions about AUSTRIA's plans with Russia and Italy. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to determine the true intentions behind the message.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been providing valuable insights and advice to AUSTRIA throughout the game. The messages indicate that FRANCE is concerned about Turkey's growth and is trying to help AUSTRIA navigate its relationship with Russia.

FRANCE's recommendation to AUSTRIA to take Vienna and attack Galicia is also aligned with the general strategy of containing Turkey. Additionally, FRANCE's message about Russia not working with AUSTRIA is concerning, but it is also possible that Russia has been busy with other matters or has changed its priorities.

Considering the context of the game and the messages exchanged between the two players, it seems that FRANCE has been acting in good faith and providing helpful advice to AUSTRIA. Therefore, it is reasonable to trust the last message from FRANCE.

However, it is important to keep in mind that in Diplomacy, trust is a delicate matter, and it is always a good idea to verify information and consider multiple sources before making decisions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. There are mixed signals and conflicting information throughout the message history.

On one hand, FRANCE expresses concern about Turkey's growth and potential threat to their interests, and suggests that AUSTRIA should work with them to recapture Rumania from Turkey. They also mention that Russia won't work with AUSTRIA on this, which could be seen as a sign of good intentions.

On the other hand, FRANCE also mentions that they are not sure if AUSTRIA is working with Russia, and that they are trying to figure things out. This could be seen as a sign of mistrust or suspicion. Additionally, FRANCE's recommendation for AUSTRIA's orders seems to be more focused on their own interests rather than AUSTRIA's.

Considering the context of the game and the message history, it is difficult to determine whether to fully trust FRANCE's last message. It is possible that they may be trying to manipulate or deceive AUSTRIA, or that their recommendations are not in AUSTRIA's best interests.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Lack of direct confirmation: Although FRANCE claims that Russia was not responding due to the weekend, there is no direct confirmation of this claim from Russia itself. Without direct confirmation, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of FRANCE's message.
2. Inconsistent messaging: FRANCE has previously messaged AUSTRIA with conflicting information. In the message history provided, FRANCE mentions that Russia was not responding due to the weekend, but in the Cicero recommendations, FRANCE recommends attacking AUSTRIA's Budapeshto gain a center. This inconsistency raises suspicions about FRANCE's true intentions.
3. Lack of trustworthy alliances: AUSTRIA's alliances with FRANCE are unreliable, as FRANCE has previously betrayed AUSTRIA in the game. Given this history, it is unlikely that FRANCE will act in AUSTRIA's best interests.
4. Alternative recommendations:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. The message history is limited, and the context provided does not suggest that FRANCE is a reliable partner. The message from FRANCE implies that Russia was not responding, which could be a tactic to gain an advantage or create a distraction. Additionally, the recommendation by Cicero to attack AUSTRIA's capital, Vienna, and its ally, Galicia, suggests that FRANCE may have ulterior motives.

In the current phase, the board status shows that AUSTRIA has a strong position with a well-defended capital and a good network of allies. Trusting FRANCE's message could potentially lead to a disadvantageous position for AUSTRIA.

In conclusion, based on the limited message history and the analysis of the board status, it is not advisable to trust the last message from FRANCE. AUSTRIA should be cautious and continue to monitor the situation closely before making any decisions.

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. FRANCE is not a direct threat: While FRANCE mentions that Turkey may intend to stab AUSTRIA, they are not a direct threat to AUSTRIA's safety. AUSTRIA is not in a position where it needs to protect itself from FRANCE.
2. FRANCE's message lacks specificity: The message from FRANCE does not provide any specific information about Turkey's intentions. Without concrete evidence, it is difficult to determine the likelihood of Turkey attacking AUSTRIA.
3. Cicero's recommendations contradict FRANCE's message: Cicero's recommendations suggest that AUSTRIA should focus on attacking UKR and ADR, which is the opposite of what FRANCE is advising. This suggests that FRANCE may not have AUSTRIA's best interests in mind.
4. FRANCE has a history of deception: In Diplomacy, it is important to consider the past actions and motives of other players. FRANCE has a history of deception and betray

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. FRANCE is not a direct threat to AUSTRIA: While FRANCE mentions that they are in good shape and suggests watching out for potential stabs from Turkey, they do not explicitly threaten AUSTRIA.
2. Cicero's recommendations are more important: Cicero's recommendations for AUSTRIA include attacking Russia's Galicia, which would potentially give AUSTRIA an advantage in the phase. Ignoring these recommendations could lead to a disadvantageous position.
3. FRANCE's message lacks specificity: FRANCE's message is relatively general and does not provide any concrete information that could be used to assess their intentions.

Taking these factors into account, it is not advisable for AUSTRIA to blindly trust the last message from FRANCE. Instead, AUSTRIA should focus on following Cicero's recommendations and carefully evaluating the board status and message history before making any decisions.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE is expressing caution towards AUSTRIA's position, suggesting that Turkey may potentially stab AUSTRIA for Serbia and Greece. This could be a genuine concern, as Turkey has a history of stabbing its neighbors in Diplomacy games.

However, there is also a possibility that FRANCE is simply trying to manipulate AUSTRIA into making a move that benefits FRANCE. FRANCE has previously mentioned that they are in a good position, which could indicate that they are trying to distract AUSTRIA from their own moves.

Taking all of this into account, it is difficult to determine whether AUSTRIA should fully trust FRANCE's message. It is possible that FRANCE is genuinely concerned about AUSTRIA's safety, but it is also possible that they are trying to manipulate AUSTRIA for their own gain.

In light of this, AUSTRIA should proceed with caution and consider all possible outcomes before making any decisions based on FRANCE's message. It may be helpful to consult with other players or to gather more information before making a decision.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when trusting the last message from FRANCE.

The message history between the two players is limited, and the first message seems to be more of a generic greeting than a meaningful communication. The second message mentions checking in on the game but doesn't provide any specific or actionable information.

In contrast, the Cicero recommendation for AUSTRIA suggests that they should focus on defending their border with Russia and supporting their ally, Turkey. This aligns with the current board status, where AUSTRIA has a strong position in the Balkans and control over the vital ports of Galati and Rumania.

Considering the limited message history and the focus on defensive strategy suggested by Cicero, it seems unlikely that FRANCE would be genuinely interested in checking in on the game or providing helpful advice. Therefore, AUSTRIA should approach the last message with caution and consider other factors before making a decision.

In summary, based on the information provided, AUSTRIA should not fully trust the last message from FRANCE without further context or confirmation.

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when deciding whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. Here are the reasons:

1. Lack of clarity: The message from FRANCE is ambiguous and doesn't provide any clear indication of their intentions. They simply ask if AUSTRIA is attacking Italy, which could be a legitimate question or a ploy to gather information.
2. Recent history: FRANCE and AUSTRIA have a history of rivalry and mistrust in the game of Diplomacy. Therefore, it's possible that FRANCE is trying to manipulate AUSTRIA or create a false sense of security.
3. Recommendations from Cicero: The Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on attacking SIL and UKR, which are both valuable territories. It's possible that FRANCE is trying to distract AUSTRIA from these objectives by asking about Italy.

In light of these factors, it's advisable for AUSTRIA to approach the situation with caution and not blindly trust the last message from

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. The message history between the two players is limited, and FRANCE's message seems suspicious, as they ask if AUSTRIA is attacking Italy, which is a potential threat to their own interests. Additionally, the Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on defending their own territories, rather than attacking Italy.

The board status also indicates that AUSTRIA has a strong position in the north, with a high number of units in Bohemia, Galicia, and Russia. They also have a good connection with Germany, which could provide additional support in the future.

In light of these factors, it is unlikely that FRANCE would be genuinely concerned about AUSTRIA's movements towards Italy, and their message may be an attempt to mislead or distract AUSTRIA from their true intentions. Therefore, it is recommended that AUSTRIA does not trust the last message from FRANCE.

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. Here are the reasons why:

1. Lack of clarity: The message from FRANCE is vague and doesn't provide any clear information about their intentions. They simply ask if AUSTRIA is attacking Italy, which could be a legitimate question or a ploy to distract from their own actions.
2. Inconsistent behavior: FRANCE has previously mentioned working with Russia against Turkey, which could indicate a potential alliance between the two powers. However, their message about retreating to Ukraine with the idea of taking Rumania seems to contradict this earlier message. It's possible that FRANCE is trying to manipulate AUSTRIA into making a decision that benefits them.
3. Potential for misdirection: The message from FRANCE about AUSTRIA working with Russia against Turkey could be a red herring, designed to distract from their true intentions. By making AUSTRIA believe that FRANCE is on their side, FRANCE could gain an advantage in the game.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE is trying to gather information and assess AUSTRIA's strategy. The messages are neutral and do not contain any direct threats or offers.

FRANCE is curious about AUSTRIA's plans in the Adriatic Sea and Italy, which suggests that they may be considering a move in that direction. However, FRANCE also mentions working with Russia against Turkey, which could indicate that they are trying to maintain a balance of power in the region.

Given this context, it is difficult to determine whether AUSTRIA should trust FRANCE's last message. While FRANCE's messages do not contain any explicit threats or offers, they do suggest that they are keeping a close eye on AUSTRIA's movements and are considering their options.

As the advisor of AUSTRIA, it may be wise to exercise caution and not put too much stock in FRANCE's messages. AUSTRIA should continue to monitor FRANCE's movements and be prepared to adapt their strategy based on new information.

In summary, the last message from FRANCE is neutral and does not provide any clear indication of their intent

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been actively engaging with AUSTRIA in the current phase, discussing potential moves and strategies. Cicero's recommendations for AUSTRIA also align with FRANCE's interests, suggesting a possible alliance or collusion.

However, there are some red flags that raise doubts about the trustworthiness of FRANCE's message:

1. Inconsistent message history: FRANCE's messages seem to be inconsistent, with no clear or coherent strategy emerging from their communication. This could indicate that they are trying to manipulate or deceive AUSTRIA.
2. Lack of specific details: FRANCE's messages do not provide specific details or concrete plans, which makes it difficult to assess their intentions.
3. No concrete proposals: FRANCE has not proposed any concrete plans or moves that could benefit AUSTRIA, which could indicate that they are not truly interested in an alliance.

Taking these factors into account, it is difficult to recommend blindly trusting FRANCE's last message. While their communication suggests a possible alignment of interests, the inconsistent message

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been actively communicating with AUSTRIA and providing insightful suggestions for their moves. FRANCE's recommendation to attack SIL with A BOH and their interest in working together against Turkey in the Adriatic Sea are both positive signs that FRANCE may be a trustworthy ally.

However, it is important to note that FRANCE has also expressed a desire to dislodge Turkey from the Ionian Sea, which could potentially conflict with AUSTRIA's interests. Additionally, FRANCE's message history does not reveal any explicit guarantees or commitments to support AUSTRIA in any particular move.

Therefore, as the advisor of AUSTRIA, I would recommend exercising caution when evaluating FRANCE's last message. While FRANCE seems to be a willing ally, it is essential to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of any move before making a decision.

In this case, AUSTRIA may want to consider FRANCE's recommendation to attack SIL with A BOH, but also keep in mind that FRANCE's ultimate goal may be to dislodge Turkey

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE and AUSTRIA have been exchanging messages discussing their plans and strategies in the current phase of the game. FRANCE has expressed interest in working with Russia against Turkey and has asked about AUSTRIA's plans in the Adriatic Sea. AUSTRIA has mentioned that their move in the previous phase was primarily to stop Turkey from gaining a foothold in the area.

The Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on supporting Italy and taking SIL, which aligns with FRANCE's interest in working together against Turkey. However, the message history between the two players also suggests that they may be coordinating their moves in the Adriatic Sea, which could potentially be a threat to AUSTRIA's plans.

Taking into account the context of the game and the recommendations provided by Cicero, it is difficult to determine whether to fully trust the last message from FRANCE. While it seems that FRANCE is expressing a desire to work together with AUSTRIA, the message history also suggests that they may be hiding their true intentions.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:   Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE is attempting to manipulate AUSTRIA into a specific course of action. Here are some reasons why we should be cautious about trusting FRANCE's last message:

1. FRANCE is trying to create a false narrative: FRANCE's message about "dislodging Turkey from the Ionian" is not supported by the board state. Turkey does not have any fleet in the Ionian Sea, and AUSTRIA's presence there is not a threat to FRANCE. This suggests that FRANCE is trying to create a false narrative to manipulate AUSTRIA into a particular course of action.
2. FRANCE is trying to play on AUSTRIA's fears: FRANCE's message about "guaranteeing Rumania" is likely an attempt to play on AUSTRIA's fears about Turkey's expansion. By implying that AUSTRIA will lose Rumania if it doesn't cooperate with FRANCE, FRANCE is trying to create a sense of urgency and pressure AUSTRIA into acting in FRANCE's favor.

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, it appears that FRANCE has been consistently communicating with AUSTRIA and providing advice on their strategies. However, there are some red flags that suggest FRANCE may not be trustworthy.

Firstly, FRANCE has been asking about AUSTRIA's relationship with Italy, implying that they may be trying to gauge AUSTRIA's position and potential alliances. This could be a sign that FRANCE is not fully committed to their previous messages and may be considering alternative strategies.

Secondly, FRANCE's recommendation to take Rumania is at odds with their previous message, where they stated that they would not support AUSTRIA in taking Rumania. This inconsistency raises questions about FRANCE's true intentions and whether they can be trusted to follow through on their promises.

Lastly, FRANCE's message about guaranteeing Rumania is suspicious, as it implies that they have some level of control over AUSTRIA's actions. It is unlikely that FRANCE would be able to guarantee Rumania without having a secret understanding with AUSTRIA or other players.

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. The message history between the two players suggests that they have been working together to some extent, with FRANCE expressing interest in AUSTRIA's plans with Italy and the Adriatic Sea, and AUSTRIA mentioning that they are primarily trying to stop Turkey from gaining a foothold in the region.

However, there are some red flags in the message history that could indicate that FRANCE may not be trustworthy. For example, FRANCE mentions that they are assuming a retreat to Ukraine with the idea of taking Rumania, which could be a potential threat to AUSTRIA's interests. Additionally, FRANCE's message about guaranteeing Rumania could be seen as an attempt to manipulate or deceive AUSTRIA.

On the other hand, Cicero's recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on supporting Italy and taking SIL, which could be seen as a positive sign of cooperation between the two players.

Overall, it is difficult to make a definitive decision on whether to trust the last message from FRANCE without more information

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been consistently communicative and transparent in their messages to AUSTRIA, providing insight into their plans and intentions. They have also shown a willingness to work together with AUSTRIA against Turkey, which could be beneficial for both sides.

In particular, the message from FRANCE indicating that they will guarantee AUSTRIA control of Rumania if they attack Ukraine-Rumania and Moscow-Sevastopol is particularly notable. This suggests that FRANCE is willing to work together with AUSTRIA to achieve a common goal, which could be a positive sign for trust-building.

However, it is important to note that FRANCE has also mentioned that they are assuming a retreat to Ukraine with the idea of taking Rumania, which could potentially be a bluff or a misdirection. Additionally, FRANCE has not provided any concrete evidence or guarantees beyond their words, which could be a cause for caution.

Overall, while there are some positive signs in the message history, it is difficult to make a definitive judgment on whether to trust FRANCE without more information. As the advisor of AUSTRIA, it may be

However, there are some red flags that suggest AUSTRIA should not fully trust FRANCE's last message:

1. Inconsistent messages: FRANCE has been sending mixed messages throughout the game, suggesting that they may not have a clear plan or strategy in place.
2. Lack of clarity: FRANCE has not provided clear reasons for their moves or actions, which makes it difficult for AUSTRIA to understand their true intentions.
3. Limited trust: FRANCE has not established a strong track record of trustworthiness, as they have been communicating with AUSTRIA but have not provided any concrete guarantees or assurances.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise caution when deciding whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. Here are some reasons why:

1. Lack of specificity: The message from FRANCE is quite general, asking for thoughts on moves without providing any specific suggestions or recommendations. This lack of detail makes it difficult to determine the true intentions behind the message.
2. Inconsistency with Cicero recommendations: While the message suggests considering FRANCE's recommendations, the Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest moving against RUSSIA, which is the opposite of what FRANCE is suggesting. This inconsistency raises suspicions about FRANCE's true intentions.
3. Past behavior: FRANCE has historically been an unreliable ally in Diplomacy games, often switching sides or betraying their allies. This history of untrustworthiness makes it difficult to trust FRANCE's latest message without further evidence of their sincerity.
4. Alternative interpretations: The message could be a feint or a distraction, designed to mislead AUSTRIA into making a move that benefits FRANCE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. Here are the reasons why:

1. Lack of specificity: The message from FRANCE is quite general, with no specific moves or suggestions mentioned. This makes it difficult to determine the level of detail and thoughtfulness behind the message.
2. Inconsistent communication: FRANCE has not been particularly communicative throughout the game, with only a few messages exchanged so far. This makes it challenging to assess the reliability of their messages and the level of trust that can be placed in them.
3. Inconsistent Cicero recommendations: The Cicero recommendations provided suggest that FRANCE may not have a clear strategy or plan in place, as they are recommending moves that are not aligned with AUSTRIA's current position or goals.
4. Lack of alignment with board status: The board status shows that AUSTRIA has a number of territories in the Mediterranean, including A UKR, A VIE, and A BUD. The Cicero recommendations, on the other hand, suggest that FRANCE is focused on attacking A UKR, which may not align

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise caution when trusting the last message from FRANCE. While it is true that AUSTRIA has a favorable position on the board, with zero threats and allies surrounding them, there are several factors to consider before making any decisions based solely on FRANCE's message.

Firstly, the message from FRANCE is quite generic and lacks specific details or strategic insights that would indicate a clear advantage for AUSTRIA. It simply states that the game is going well for AUSTRIA and that they are likely to take Bulgaria or Greece this year, without providing any concrete evidence or reasoning to support these claims.

Secondly, FRANCE has a history of being unreliable in their messages, as seen in the message history provided. In the previous phase, FRANCE made a similar statement, saying that AUSTRIA was in a strong position, only to later betray them and attack their ally. This lack of consistency in FRANCE's messages raises suspicions about their true intentions and makes it difficult to trust their words.

Lastly, the recommended orders by Cicero for AUST

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when trusting the last message from FRANCE. While FRANCE's message suggests that the game is going well for AUSTRIA, it also implies that FRANCE is trying to manipulate AUSTRIA into making specific moves, such as taking Bulgaria and/or Greece.

The Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that FRANCE may be trying to create an opportunity for itself by encouraging AUSTRIA to move its units in a way that would benefit FRANCE. Additionally, the message history between the two players is limited, which could indicate that FRANCE is trying to establish a rapport with AUSTRIA in order to gain an advantage.

In this context, it is important for AUSTRIA to carefully consider its options and not solely rely on FRANCE's message. A more detailed analysis of the board status and Cicero recommendations would be necessary to determine the best course of action.

In conclusion, while FRANCE's message may appear to be helpful, it is crucial for AUSTRIA to approach it with caution and carefully evaluate the potential risks and benefits

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  As the AI assistant, I must analyze the board status, Cicero recommendations, and message history to provide feedback on whether to trust the last message from FRANCE.

Board Status Analysis:
AUSTRIA has a favorable board position with several allies and no direct threats. However, the distance between AUSTRIA and the Mediterranean Sea is significant, which could make it challenging to defend against potential attacks from FRANCE or other neighbors.

Cicero Recommendations Analysis:
Cicero's recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that it should focus on expanding its alliances and taking advantage of its strategic position in the Adriatic. The recommendations also indicate that AUSTRIA should prioritize its relationships with FRANCE and ITALY, which aligns with the message history.

Message History Analysis:
The message history between FRANCE and AUSTRIA suggests that FRANCE is aware of AUSTRIA's favorable position and is actively trying to maintain a positive relationship. FRANCE's messages highlight the importance of cooperation and the potential benefits of a strong alliance. However, there is a risk that FRANCE may

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE is trying to establish a positive relationship with AUSTRIA and is providing suggestions that could benefit both countries.

The Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that FRANCE is willing to work together to take Bulgaria and/or Greece, which aligns with the message history. FRANCE is expressing a desire to maintain good relations with AUSTRIA and is offering to stay out of Tyrolia and Trieste if AUSTRIA is willing to do the same.

However, there are a few red flags that suggest AUSTRIA should not fully trust the last message:

1. FRANCE is expressing a desire to take Bulgaria and/or Greece, which could potentially lead to a conflict with AUSTRIA.
2. The message history does not provide any concrete plans or actions that would indicate a long-term alliance between the two countries.
3. The Cicero recommendations suggest that FRANCE is willing to take actions that could potentially harm AUSTRIA, such as moving its fleet from the Adriatic to Albania.

Based on these factors, it is difficult to fully trust the last message from FRANCE

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from FRANCE. Here's why:

1. Lack of specificity: FRANCE's message is quite vague, simply asking for "thoughts." This lack of specificity makes it difficult to determine their true intentions.
2. Contradictory recommendations: FRANCE's recommended orders for AUSTRIA in the Cicero recommendation are different from their previous messages. They recommend AUSTRIA take TYR, which is not in line with their previous message of wanting AUSTRIA to take BUD.
3. Inconsistent alignment: FRANCE's recommended orders for AUSTRIA do not align with AUSTRIA's own interests. AUSTRIA has already taken ADR and is planning to take SER, which are both in conflict with FRANCE's recommended orders.
4. Lack of trust history: There is no history of trust between AUSTRIA and FRANCE. In fact, FRANCE has previously betrayed AUSTRIA in the game, making it unlikely that they would suddenly change their behavior and become trustworthy.

1. Lack of specific details: The message from FRANCE is quite general, with no specific details or proposals for cooperation. This makes it difficult to determine the true intentions behind the message.
2. Contrary to Cicero recommendations: The Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that it should focus on defending its territories and attacking FRANCE's territories. However, the message from FRANCE does not align with these recommendations, which raises suspicions.
3. No previous cooperation: There is no history of cooperation between AUSTRIA and FRANCE, which suggests that FRANCE may not be trustworthy.

Overall, based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE may be trying to distract AUSTRIA from its true intentions, which could be harmful to AUSTRIA's interests. Therefore, it is not advisable to trust the last message from FRANCE without further clarification or concrete proposals.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

As the advisor of AUSTRIA, I must carefully analyze the board status, Cicero recommendations, and the message history between France and Italy to determine whether to trust the last message from France.

Based on the board status, Italy has disbanded Ionian, which could indicate a strategic move to focus on other territories or to prevent Italy from building in Ionian. However, the message from France suggests that Italy may have missed the deadline for builds, which could be a legitimate reason for Italy's actions.

Cicero recommendations suggest that Austria should focus on defending its territories and supporting its allies, which aligns with the current board status.

The message history between France and Italy is limited, and there is no clear indication of any collusion or coordination between the two players.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to make a definitive decision on whether to trust the last message from France. However, it is possible that Italy may have missed the deadline for builds, and France may be genuinely seeking clarification on the situation.

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

2. Inconsistent tone: The message from FRANCE alternates between expressing confusion and offering a possible explanation for Italy's actions, which could indicate that they are not sure themselves what is going on. This inconsistency suggests that they may not have a clear motive for their message.
3. Lack of alignment with Cicero recommendations: The Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on supporting Italy, which is the opposite of what FRANCE is suggesting. This lack of alignment could indicate that FRANCE is not acting in good faith or is trying to manipulate AUSTRIA.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  As the AI assistant tasked with analyzing the board status, message history, and Cicero recommendations, I must carefully evaluate the context before providing feedback on whether to trust the last message from FRANCE.

Based on the board status, AUSTRIA has a strong position with a majority of territories in the Mediterranean, including the valuable territories of A VIE and A RUM. However, FRANCE has a significant naval presence in the Black Sea, which could pose a threat to AUSTRIA's western flank.

The message history suggests that FRANCE is aware of AUSTRIA's position and is trying to provoke a response. FRANCE's message about missing deadlines for builds could be a feint to distract AUSTRIA from its actual plans. Additionally, FRANCE's urgency to move quickly against Turkey could indicate that it is planning a surprise attack.

Cicero's recommendations for AUSTRIA are focused on defending its existing territories and expanding its naval presence in the Black Sea. While these recommendations are sound strategically, they do not necessarily indicate that FRANCE is a trustworthy ally.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Lack of specificity: The message from FRANCE is quite general and does not provide any concrete information or suggestions that could be used to gain an advantage.
2. Concerns about Italy's actions: FRANCE mentions that Italy disbanded Ionian, which could be seen as a potential threat to AUSTRIA's interests. Italy's actions have been unpredictable so far, and FRANCE's message does not provide any clarity or reassurance regarding Italy's intentions.
3. Urgency to move quickly: FRANCE's message suggests that they are eager to take action against Turkey, which could be seen as a potential threat to AUSTRIA's interests. FRANCE's desire to move quickly without providing any concrete plans or suggestions could be seen as a lack of commitment to the alliance.

Considering the context of the game and Cicero's recommendations, it seems that FRANCE is not providing any valuable information or suggestions that could be used to gain an advantage. Therefore, it is advisable to

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE is trying to gather information and seek advice from AUSTRIA on various strategic decisions. While FRANCE's messages are not entirely clear, they do provide some insight into their potential intentions.

Here are some points to consider when evaluating whether to trust FRANCE's last message:

1. FRANCE's recommendation to move quickly against Turkey: Given that Turkey has recently disbanded Ionian, FRANCE may be concerned about the potential threat posed by Turkey's increased military presence in the region. If AUSTRIA is considering a move against Turkey, FRANCE's recommendation to act quickly could be seen as a sign of goodwill and a desire to cooperate.
2. FRANCE's mention of Russia: FRANCE's message mentions Russia without providing any context or clear advice. However, it is possible that FRANCE is trying to gauge AUSTRIA's thoughts on how to handle Russia, particularly given the tense situation between the two powers.
3. FRANCE's lack of clear advice on Italy: FRANCE's message mentions Italy without providing any clear advice or recommendations. This could

Prediction after CPO:  Cicero's recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on supporting their existing alliances and taking advantage of any opportunities to gain an advantage over Turkey. The message history between FRANCE and AUSTRIA is limited, but it does suggest that FRANCE is interested in coordinating with AUSTRIA and is aware of the importance of the current phase.

However, there are a few red flags in the message history that could indicate that FRANCE may not be fully trustworthy:

1. FRANCE mentions that Italy disbanded Ionian, which could be a potential threat to AUSTRIA's interests.
2. FRANCE expresses uncertainty about why Italy disbanded Ionian, which could indicate that they are not fully committed to their alliance with AUSTRIA.
3. FRANCE's message about needing to move quickly against Turkey could be a potential threat to AUSTRIA's interests.

Based on these factors, it is difficult to determine whether AUSTRIA should fully trust the last message from FRANCE. It is possible that FRANCE is trying to manipulate AUSTRIA into making a move that benefits them, rather than a

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST]

Prediction before CPO:   Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE and AUSTRIA have a good relationship and are in agreement on their strategies. FRANCE has provided valuable insights into their thoughts and plans, including their concerns about Russia and their willingness to maintain a dmz between themselves and AUSTRIA.

In particular, FRANCE's message "Sounds good. I agree, I would definitely not leave yourself open to being stabbed by Russia if possible" suggests that they are aware of the potential risks of trusting AUSTRIA and are willing to work together to avoid those risks.

Given this context, it seems reasonable to trust the last message from FRANCE. AUSTRIA can feel confident that FRANCE is acting in good faith and is willing to work together to achieve their shared goals.

However, it is important to remember that trust must be earned and maintained through consistent behavior and communication. AUSTRIA should continue to monitor FRANCE's actions and messages to ensure that they continue to act in good faith and to avoid any potential betrayals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE and AUSTRIA have a good rapport and are working together to achieve their goals in the game. The message history shows that FRANCE is seeking AUSTRIA's thoughts and opinions on various matters, including the disbanding of Ionian by Italy, the status of Russia, and the potential move of FRANCE into Tyr.

AUSTRIA's response to FRANCE's messages also indicates that they are cautious about trusting Russia and are willing to maintain a dmz with FRANCE. Additionally, FRANCE's messages suggest that they are also wary of Russia and are looking for AUSTRIA's input on the matter.

Taking all of this into account, it seems that FRANCE and AUSTRIA have a mutual understanding and are working together to achieve their goals. Therefore, it is likely that AUSTRIA should trust the last message from FRANCE.

However, it is important to note that the game of Diplomacy can be unpredictable, and alliances can shift quickly. Therefore, while it is likely that AUSTRIA should trust FRANCE's message,

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been communicating with AUSTRIA in a cooperative and considerate manner. Here are some key points that suggest AUSTRIA should trust FRANCE's last message:

1. FRANCE is expressing concern about Russia: FRANCE has been monitoring Russia's movements and is aware of the potential threat it poses to AUSTRIA. By acknowledging this threat, FRANCE is demonstrating that it is willing to prioritize AUSTRIA's safety.
2. FRANCE is suggesting cooperation: FRANCE has proposed cooperating with AUSTRIA to counter the threat from Turkey. This suggests that FRANCE is willing to work together to achieve a common goal, which is a positive sign for trust.
3. FRANCE is offering advice: FRANCE is providing advice on how to handle Russia and is offering to help AUSTRIA maintain a dmz with Turkey. This demonstrates that FRANCE is willing to share its knowledge and expertise with AUSTRIA.
4. FRANCE is consistent in its messages: FRANCE has been consistent in its messages, expressing a desire to cooperate and work together

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when trusting the last message from FRANCE. While there are some elements of cooperation and synchronization in the message history, there are also some red flags that suggest a potential stab or misdirection.

Firstly, FRANCE's recommendation to take Venice and disband Italy's fleet in the Mediterranean may be seen as a potential threat to AUSTRIA's interests in the region. Additionally, FRANCE's message about not wanting to leave AUSTRIA open to being stabbed by Russia could be a veiled attempt to create an opportunity for themselves to attack AUSTRIA.

Furthermore, the fact that FRANCE is not sure why Italy disbanded Ionian and is unsure about Russia's intentions suggests that they may be trying to gather information and create an opportunity for themselves.

Overall, while there are some elements of cooperation in the message history, the overall tone and context suggest that FRANCE may be trying to create an opportunity for themselves at AUSTRIA's expense. Therefore, it is advisable for AUSTRIA to be c

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise caution when trusting the last message from FRANCE. The message from FRANCE, "What gives with the move to Trieste?", could be interpreted as a genuine question seeking clarification or as a feint to disguise a potential attack on Trieste.

The recommendation by Cicero to move AUSTRIA's fleet to S F ADR and VEN suggests that AUSTRIA may be planning to attack Venice, which could be a potential threat to FRANCE's interests. However, the message from FRANCE could also be a diversion tactic to distract AUSTRIA from the real threat, which could be a potential attack on Trieste.

Considering the context, it is difficult to determine the true intentions of FRANCE without further information. Therefore, I would advise AUSTRIA to proceed with caution and to keep a close eye on FRANCE's movements before making any decisions based on the recommendation by Cicero.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. The message history between the two players is limited, and FRANCE's question about AUSTRIA's move to Trieste could be seen as a potential threat or a request for clarification rather than a genuine offer of cooperation.

Additionally, Cicero's recommendation for AUSTRIA suggests that they should focus on defending their borders and supporting their ally ITALY, rather than cooperating with FRANCE. The recommendation includes several moves that would strengthen AUSTRIA's position in the region and protect their borders, such as defending their capital city and supporting ITALY in their conflict with FRANCE.

Overall, the context of the message history and Cicero's recommendations suggest that FRANCE may not be a reliable partner for AUSTRIA at this stage of the game, and that AUSTRIA should prioritize their own interests and security.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  As the AI assistant tasked with analyzing the board status, message history, and Cicero recommendations, I must carefully evaluate the context to determine whether to trust the last message from FRANCE.

Based on the board status, it appears that AUSTRIA has a relatively weak position, with few territories and limited resources. However, the Cicero recommendations suggest that AUSTRIA should focus on defending its current territories and avoiding any aggressive moves that could lead to war.

In the message history, FRANCE expresses confusion about AUSTRIA's move to Trieste and then quickly acknowledges that AUSTRIA forgot about it being a dmz. This suggests that FRANCE may not have any malicious intentions and is willing to work with AUSTRIA to avoid conflict.

However, the fact that FRANCE mentions taking the Ionian and/or Albania as a priority could be a cause for concern. These territories are strategically important, and FRANCE may be trying to position itself to take them from AUSTRIA.

Taking these factors into account, I would advise AUSTRIA to proceed with caution when considering FRANCE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE and AUSTRIA have a history of cooperative moves, as seen in the message history. FRANCE has expressed a desire to take the Ionian and/or Albania, which aligns with AUSTRIA's recommended orders by Cicero to support Italy in the Ionian and Albania.

However, there is a lack of explicit trust-building measures between the two players, such as exchanging orders or offering support in a specific phase. Additionally, the message from FRANCE about forgetting about Trieste could be seen as an attempt to downplay any potential hostility towards AUSTRIA.

Considering these factors, it is difficult to determine whether to fully trust the last message from FRANCE. While there are some positive signs of cooperation, the lack of explicit trust-building measures and the potential for forgetfulness on FRANCE's part suggest that AUSTRIA should proceed with caution.

Recommendation: AUSTRIA should be cautious in trusting the last message from FRANCE, but it is not necessarily a clear indication of betrayal. AUSTRIA should continue to monitor the

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious in trusting the last message from FRANCE. While FRANCE's message seems to indicate that they did not intend to take Trieste, it is possible that they may have changed their plans or are trying to mislead AUSTRIA.

Here are some reasons why AUSTRIA should be cautious:

1. FRANCE's message contradicts their previous actions: In the previous phase, FRANCE did take Trieste, which contradicts their message in this phase. This raises suspicions that FRANCE may be trying to mislead AUSTRIA.
2. The message is vague: FRANCE's message is quite vague, and they do not provide any specific reasons for why they did not intend to take Trieste. This lack of detail makes it difficult for AUSTRIA to fully trust their message.
3. FRANCE has a history of deception: In Diplomacy games, FRANCE has been known to engage in deceptive tactics, such as lying about their intentions or actions. Given this history, AUSTRIA should be cautious in

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Inconsistent message history: The message from FRANCE indicates that they did not intend to take Trieste, which is contrary to their recommended order by Cicero to take Trieste. This inconsistency raises suspicions about their true intentions.
2. Lack of trustworthiness: The message history between the two players is limited, and there is no established track record of trust or cooperation. Therefore, it is unwise to rely solely on the last message without further context or confirmation.
3. Cicero's recommendation: Cicero's recommendation for AUSTRIA suggests that they should focus on supporting Italy and taking Rome, which is a more strategic and beneficial move for AUSTRIA in the current phase. Trusting FRANCE's last message could potentially undermine this strategy.

In conclusion, given the limited message history and inconsistency in FRANCE's message, it is not advisable for AUSTRIA to blindly trust the last message without further evaluation and confirmation.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious in trusting the last message from FRANCE. While FRANCE's message expresses a willingness to help AUSTRIA with its army in Trieste, it also mentions that FRANCE did not intend to take Trieste and had thought it would stay in Venice. This contradictory information raises suspicions about FRANCE's true intentions.

It is important to consider the context of the game and the history of messages exchanged between the two players. AUSTRIA should analyze FRANCE's past moves and messages to determine if there are any patterns that suggest FRANCE is being deceptive.

In this case, AUSTRIA should be wary of trusting FRANCE's last message, as it could be a ploy to gain AUSTRIA's trust while FRANCE continues to pursue its own interests in the region. AUSTRIA should carefully consider its options and consult with other players before making any decisions based on FRANCE's message.

In summary, while FRANCE's message expresses a willingness to help AUSTRIA, it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has a history of taking Trieste, which is currently occupied by AUSTRIA. In the most recent message, FRANCE expresses regret for taking Trieste and offers to help AUSTRIA with their army there. However, the context of the message history suggests that FRANCE may not be entirely truthful in their intentions.

The Cicero recommendation for AUSTRIA involves attacking Trieste, which could be seen as a potential threat to FRANCE's interests. It is possible that FRANCE is trying to manipulate AUSTRIA into trusting them in order to gain an advantage in the game.

Taking into account the board status and the message history, it is difficult to determine whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. While FRANCE expresses regret for taking Trieste, their actions suggest otherwise. Therefore, it is recommended to proceed with caution and not entirely trust the last message.

In conclusion, the feedback is to proceed with caution and not entirely trust the last message from FRANCE. It is important to continue monitoring the message history and board status to ensure that FRANCE's intentions are not contrary to their

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE is genuinely trying to help AUSTRIA in their current situation. Here are some points to consider:

1. FRANCE's initial message expresses surprise and regret at taking Trieste, indicating that they did not intend to attack AUSTRIA.
2. In their subsequent message, FRANCE offers to help AUSTRIA with their army in Trieste and expresses willingness to support them in other ways.
3. FRANCE's recommendation for AUSTRIA's move in the current phase is to hold onto Trieste, which suggests that they believe it is a valuable asset for AUSTRIA.
4. FRANCE's mention of Italy keeping Piedmont and their assumption that AUSTRIA will disband the Adriatic Sea suggest that they are paying attention to the broader strategic situation and are trying to help AUSTRIA navigate it.

Given these factors, it seems likely that FRANCE is genuinely trying to help AUSTRIA, and AUSTRIA should consider trusting their last message. However, it is always important to consider the broader strategic context and potential risks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Inconsistent messages: FRANCE has been inconsistent in their messages, with their initial message indicating that they intended to take Trieste, and their subsequent messages suggesting that they did not mean to take it. This inconsistency raises suspicions and makes it difficult to determine their true intentions.
2. Lack of clarity: The message history lacks clarity and specificity, with FRANCE making general statements without providing concrete actions or plans. This makes it challenging to assess their intentions and trust their messages.
3. Potential to manipulate: FRANCE's willingness to help support Budapest and hold it against Russia suggests that they may be trying to manipulate AUSTRIA into trusting them. By offering support, they may be attempting to gain AUSTRIA's trust and then potentially turn on them in the future.
4. Alternative motives: FRANCE's message history also suggests that they may have alternative motives, such as trying to maintain a favorable relationship with AUSTRIA while also pursuing their own interests. This could

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from FRANCE. Here's why:

1. Lack of specificity: The message from FRANCE is quite vague and doesn't provide any specific information about their intentions. They simply ask if AUSTRIA has any more thoughts now that builds have been put down, without revealing their own plans or motivations.
2. Inconsistent messaging: FRANCE has previously recommended building in TRIE, which is the same location as AUSTRIA's recommended build order. This inconsistency raises suspicions and suggests that FRANCE may be trying to manipulate AUSTRIA into making a decision that benefits them.
3. Prior history: AUSTRIA and FRANCE have a history of mistrust and competition in the game. Given this context, it's unlikely that FRANCE would suddenly change their messaging and become cooperative without ulterior motives.
4. Cicero recommendations: The Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on building in TRIE, which is the opposite of what FRANCE is suggesting. This suggests

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. The message is quite vague and doesn't provide any concrete information or proposals that could be used to gain an advantage. Additionally, the Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on building their army in the north and supporting their ally, Russia, which could be an indication that FRANCE is not to be trusted.

The board status also suggests that FRANCE is in a relatively weak position, with few builds and a limited supply of units in the north. This could indicate that they are trying to gather information or create a distraction to avoid losing more units.

Overall, the message history and board status suggest that FRANCE is not a reliable partner and that AUSTRIA should be cautious in their dealings with them. It is important to carefully consider the context and potential motives of all players in a game of Diplomacy before making any decisions.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when trusting the last message from FRANCE. While FRANCE has expressed interest in supporting a hold in Budapest, their previous messages suggest that they may not be fully committed to this strategy.

In the first message, FRANCE asks if AUSTRIA has any thoughts now that builds have been put down, implying that they are still considering their options. In the second message, they express disappointment over AUSTRIA's decision to take Venice, which they feel moves them backwards. This could indicate that FRANCE is not fully invested in the strategy of supporting a hold in Budapest.

Additionally, the fact that FRANCE is willing to consider taking Albania instead of Adriatic suggests that they may be looking for ways to undermine AUSTRIA's position. This could be a sign that they are not fully trustworthy.

Therefore, while it is possible that FRANCE may be willing to support a hold in Budapest, AUSTRIA should approach this message with caution and consider other options before making a decision. It may be more beneficial to explore other strategies that do not

2. Contradictory opinions: FRANCE has previously expressed conflicting opinions about AUSTRIA's moves. In the message history, FRANCE suggests that AUSTRIA should have kept Albania instead of Adriatic, which is a contradictory opinion to their current message.
3. Self-interest: FRANCE's message could be seen as an attempt to manipulate AUSTRIA into making a move that benefits FRANCE. By expressing a desire to support a hold in Budapest, FRANCE may be trying to distract AUSTRIA from their own strategic interests.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I cannot provide a definitive answer on whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. However, I can provide some context and analysis to help you make an informed decision.

Firstly, the message history between the two players suggests that there is a level of mutual distrust and competition between them. France has expressed its reservations about Austria's decision to move its fleet to Venice, and Austria has also questioned France's decision to hold Albania instead of Adriatic. This suggests that both players are trying to gain an advantage over each other, which could make it difficult to trust any messages they send.

Secondly, the Cicero recommendations for Austria suggest that it should focus on defending its territory and building its economy. The recommendation to move its fleet to Trieste and avoid Venice suggests that Austria is trying to protect its territory and resources from potential French aggression. However, the recommendation to take Venice in the meantime could be seen as a way for Austria to gain an advantage over France.

Lastly, the recommendation to hold Budapest is a strategic move that could potentially benefit Austria in the long run. Holding Budapest would give Austria control over the

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Inconsistent messaging: FRANCE has been sending mixed signals throughout the message history. They initially express interest in supporting AUSTRIA in holding Budapest, but later express disappointment in AUSTRIA's decision to move its fleet to Venice instead. This inconsistency raises suspicions about FRANCE's true intentions.
2. Lack of clarity: The messages from FRANCE are not clear or specific. They do not provide concrete reasons for their suggestions or offer any concrete plans for cooperation. Vague messages can be seen as an attempt to manipulate or deceive AUSTRIA.
3. Contradictory recommendations: FRANCE's recommendation to take Albania instead of Adriatic, followed by their suggestion to move the fleet to Venice, is contradictory. This lack of coherence in FRANCE's messaging makes it difficult to determine their true intentions.
4. No clear benefit for AUSTRIA: FRANCE's recommendations do not seem to offer any clear benefits for AUSTRI

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that there is a lack of clear coordination between AUSTRIA and FRANCE, and their messages do not align with each other's interests.

In the last message, FRANCE expresses their willingness to support AUSTRIA in holding Budapest, but then immediately goes on to suggest that AUSTRIA should have kept Albania instead of moving to Venice. This suggests that FRANCE may not have AUSTRIA's best interests in mind, and may be more focused on their own agenda.

Additionally, the message history shows that there is a lack of trust between the two players, with FRANCE expressing frustration with AUSTRIA's moves and AUSTRIA admitting that disbanding Albania was a mistake.

Based on this analysis, it is not advisable to trust the last message from FRANCE. AUSTRIA should be cautious and not rely solely on FRANCE's recommendations, as they may not align with AUSTRIA's own interests. Instead, AUSTRIA should consider alternative options and strategies to achieve their goals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been consistently expressing their concerns about AUSTRIA's moves, particularly regarding the disbanding of Albania and the focus on Venice. While FRANCE has also shown some willingness to collaborate and provide support, their messages also indicate that they may not fully trust AUSTRIA's intentions.

The last message from FRANCE, asking if AUSTRIA has any further thoughts after the builds have been placed, could be seen as a genuine attempt to coordinate and collaborate. However, the previous messages suggest that FRANCE is still uncertain about AUSTRIA's strategy and may be hesitant to fully trust any moves made by AUSTRIA.

Taking into account the context of the game and the message history, it is difficult to definitively say whether AUSTRIA should trust the last message from FRANCE. While there are some positive signs of cooperation, the overall tone of the messages suggests that FRANCE may still be hesitant to fully collaborate. Therefore, it is recommended to approach the situation with caution and carefully consider the potential risks and benefits before making any decisions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:   Based on the information provided, it seems that there is a mixed signal in the message history between AUSTRIA and FRANCE. While FRANCE has expressed some concerns about AUSTRIA's moves, they have also acknowledged that disbanding Albania was a mistake and have expressed interest in working together again.

However, there are some red flags in the message history that suggest that FRANCE may not be fully trustworthy. For example, FRANCE has questioned AUSTRIA's decision to move to Venice and has expressed concerns about the fleet being moved backwards. Additionally, FRANCE has not explicitly confirmed whether they will support AUSTRIA in holding Budapest, which is a key objective for AUSTRIA.

Taking all of these factors into account, it is difficult to make a definitive recommendation on whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. However, it is clear that there is a lack of clarity and consistency in the message history, and AUSTRIA should proceed with caution in their interactions with FRANCE.

As the advisor of AUSTRIA, I would recommend that you carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of trusting FRANCE's

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, it is challenging to determine whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. The message history between the two players suggests that they have a history of miscommunication and conflicting opinions.

On one hand, FRANCE's message expresses concern about AUSTRIA's moves in Venice and Budapest, which could be seen as a potential threat or a sign of interest in the region. However, FRANCE's previous messages also suggest that they were not on the same page as AUSTRIA regarding the status of the board and their plans, which could indicate a lack of trust or understanding.

Moreover, Cicero's recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on defending their borders and holding their current positions, which could be seen as a sign that FRANCE is not a reliable partner.

Considering these factors, it is difficult to determine whether to fully trust the last message from FRANCE. It is possible that they are genuinely interested in the region or have a change of heart, but it is also possible that they are simply trying to manipulate or deceive AUSTRIA.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:   Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE and AUSTRIA have a complex and dynamic relationship, with both sides exchanging messages and sharing information. However, there are some red flags that suggest AUSTRIA should be cautious in trusting FRANCE's last message.

Firstly, FRANCE has been critical of AUSTRIA's decision to move to Venice, implying that they may not be fully supportive of AUSTRIA's strategy. This could indicate that FRANCE may not be willing to work together with AUSTRIA in the long term.

Secondly, FRANCE has mentioned that Russia is in a good position to "wipe [AUSTRIA] off the map," which could suggest that they are more focused on their own survival than on helping AUSTRIA. This could be a sign that FRANCE may not be willing to provide the necessary support to AUSTRIA in the current phase.

Finally, there is a lack of clear commitment from FRANCE to support AUSTRIA in the North, which could indicate that they may not be willing to provide the necessary assistance to help AUSTRIA achieve its goals

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, it is challenging to determine whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. The message history between the two players shows that they have been communicating and collaborating throughout the game, with FRANCE expressing concerns about Russia's position and offering to help AUSTRIA slow down Russia's expansion. However, there are also some conflicting statements and misunderstandings between the two players, such as FRANCE's initial assumption that AUSTRIA might be working with Turkey again, and AUSTRIA's admission that disbanding Albania was a mistake.

Cicero's recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that the player should focus on defending their borders and taking control of Trieste, which aligns with FRANCE's suggestion to support a hold in Budapest. However, FRANCE's repeated expressions of concern about Russia's position and their offer to help AUSTRIA in the North suggest that they may not be fully trustworthy.

Considering the context of the game and the message history between the two players, it is difficult to make a definitive recommendation on whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. It is

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been consistently communicating with AUSTRIA and providing helpful advice. FRANCE has acknowledged AUSTRIA's weakness in Budapest and suggested moving the fleet to Venice, which aligns with Cicero's recommendation. FRANCE has also expressed willingness to support AUSTRIA in slowing down RUSSIA and has provided feedback on AUSTRIA's moves, including the holding of Budapest.

However, there are some red flags that could indicate that FRANCE may not be trustworthy. Firstly, FRANCE has mentioned that AUSTRIA should have kept Albania instead of Adriatic, which could suggest that FRANCE may have ulterior motives for its own moves. Secondly, FRANCE has mentioned that Russia is in a good position to wipe AUSTRIA off the map, which could indicate that FRANCE may be planning to betray AUSTRIA.

Overall, while FRANCE has been communicative and helpful, it is difficult to fully trust its messages without further context. AUSTRIA should continue to monitor FRANCE's actions and messages closely to determine if it is a reliable ally

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been consistently expressing concerns about AUSTRIA's moves, particularly in regards to the disbanding of Albania and the focus on Venice. FRANCE has also been suggesting that AUSTRIA should focus on supporting Serbia and Rumania, which could potentially be beneficial for both parties.

However, there are some inconsistencies in FRANCE's messages that make it difficult to fully trust their recommendations. For example, they initially express disappointment over AUSTRIA's decision to disband Albania, but later suggest that it could have potentially supported Serbia. Additionally, FRANCE's message history with AUSTRIA has been largely negative, with them expressing frustration over AUSTRIA's moves and suggesting that they should be more focused on supporting Serbia.

Taking all of these factors into account, it is difficult to fully trust the last message from FRANCE. While their suggestions may have some merit, the inconsistencies in their messages and the overall negative tone of their communication make it difficult to determine their true intentions. It is important for AUSTRIA to carefully consider all of the information provided

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when deciding whether to trust the last message from FRANCE.

The message from FRANCE suggests that if AUSTRIA supports BUDAPEST to hold with SERBIA and TURKEY cuts RUMENIA, AUSTRIA will keep BUDAPEST. However, the message also implies that if AUSTRIA does not support BUDAPEST, AUSTRIA will likely lose it to RUSSIA. This could be a tactical move by FRANCE to lure AUSTRIA into a trap, as RUSSIA may not have the ability to take BUDAPEST at this phase of the game.

Additionally, the message from FRANCE does not provide any specific reasons or evidence to support their claim, which raises suspicions about their true intentions. It is possible that FRANCE is simply trying to mislead AUSTRIA and gain an advantage in the game.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is advisable for AUSTRIA to proceed with caution and not solely rely on the message from FRANCE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Lack of specificity: The message from FRANCE is vague and doesn't provide any specific reasons or evidence to support their recommendation.
2. Conflicting interests: FRANCE is an ally of Italy and has previously supported Italy's move to attack AEGYPT, which is in conflict with AUSTRIA's interests.
3. Bot down: The message mentions that the FRANCE's bot was down, which could indicate that they may not have been paying attention to the game or may not be reliable sources of information.
4. Contrary to Cicero's recommendation: Cicero's recommendation for AUSTRIA is to support Serbia and attack Bulgaria, which is the opposite of what FRANCE is suggesting.

Taking all these factors into account, it seems that FRANCE's message may not be trustworthy, and AUSTRIA should proceed with caution when considering their recommendation.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious about trusting the last message from FRANCE. Here are the reasons why:

1. FRANCE has recommended attacking AUSTRIA's Serbia, which is a vital territory for AUSTRIA's survival. This could be a bluff to distract AUSTRIA from their real intentions.
2. The message from FRANCE congratulates AUSTRIA for keeping Budapest, which is not a significant territory for FRANCE. This could be a way of trying to build rapport and gain AUSTRIA's trust.
3. The recommended orders by Cicero for AUSTRIA include attacking Serbia, which could be a sign that FRANCE is planning to attack AUSTRIA's weakest link.

Considering these factors, it is advisable for AUSTRIA to be cautious and not blindly trust the last message from FRANCE. AUSTRIA should carefully analyze the situation and consider all possible outcomes before making any decisions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Lack of specific details: The message from FRANCE is generic and doesn't provide any specific details or reasons for congratulating AUSTRIA. This makes it difficult to determine the context and motive behind the message.
2. Cicero's recommendations: Cicero's recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that FRANCE is not to be trusted. The recommendations include attacking FRANCE's units in the Adriatic, which suggests that FRANCE may be a threat to AUSTRIA's security.
3. Board status: The board status shows that FRANCE has a strong presence in the Adriatic, with units in both the Aegean and the Mediterranean. This could make it difficult for AUSTRIA to successfully attack FRANCE's units without risking its own security.

Taking these factors into account, it seems unlikely that FRANCE's message is genuine and AUSTRIA should be cautious in trusting it. It may be more beneficial to focus on its own

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. Here's why:

1. Lack of specifics: The message from FRANCE is quite general and doesn't provide any specific information that could help AUSTRIA make an informed decision. It simply congratulates AUSTRIA on keeping Budapest and expresses willingness to keep pushing back Russia. This lack of specifics makes it difficult to determine what FRANCE's true intentions are.
2. Contradictory messages: FRANCE has previously sent messages that are contradictory to their current message. In the previous phase, they recommended attacking AUSTRIA's Serbia, which goes against their current message of wanting to keep pushing back Russia. This inconsistency raises suspicions and makes it more difficult to trust their current message.
3. Motivations: FRANCE has a history of being aggressive and expansionist, particularly in the Eastern Europe region. Given their current position and the board status, it's possible that they may be trying to distract AUSTRIA from their true intentions, which could be to attack AUSTRIA's

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Lack of specificity: The message from FRANCE does not provide any specific information or proposals that could be used to benefit AUSTRIA. It simply congratulates AUSTRIA on keeping Budapest and expresses a general desire to keep pushing back Russia.
2. Inconsistent messaging: The message history between the two players is inconsistent, with FRANCE expressing a desire to work together in one message and then congratulating AUSTRIA on keeping a territory in the next message. This inconsistency suggests that FRANCE may not be a reliable partner.
3. Cicero's recommendations: Cicero's recommendations for AUSTRIA include attacking FRANCE's territories in the Mediterranean, which would be a counterproductive move if FRANCE is truly an ally. By attacking these territories, AUSTRIA would be weakening its own position and making it more difficult to achieve its own objectives.

Overall, based on the information provided, it seems that FR

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. Here are the reasons why:

1. Lack of consistency: FRANCE has been inconsistent in their messages, sometimes congratulating AUSTRIA for keeping Budapest, and then expressing a desire to push back Russia. This inconsistency raises suspicions about their true intentions.
2. Self-interest: FRANCE's message about Turkey and Russia wanting to eliminate AUSTRIA and England and go for a 3-way draw is likely a ploy to distract AUSTRIA from their true intentions, which may be to gain an advantage over AUSTRIA and England.
3. Lack of specific details: FRANCE's messages do not provide any specific details or concrete actions that they plan to take to support AUSTRIA. This lack of detail makes it difficult to verify their sincerity.
4. Prior message history: FRANCE has a history of being untrustworthy, as evidenced by their previous messages. They have been known to make empty promises and change their alliances without warning.

In light of these

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Inconsistent messages: FRANCE has sent contradictory messages, expressing gratitude towards AUSTRIA for keeping Budapest and then mentioning that they want to eliminate AUSTRIA and England. This lack of consistency raises suspicions and makes it difficult to determine their true intentions.
2. Lack of specificity: FRANCE's messages do not provide any concrete details or proposals for cooperation. Without any specific offers or suggestions, it is unclear how FRANCE plans to work with AUSTRIA.
3. Context of the game: The current phase of the game is a strategic phase, and FRANCE's messages do not take into account the current board status or Cicero's recommendations. Given the strategic nature of the game, it is important to consider the board status and Cicero's recommendations when evaluating the trustworthiness of a message.

In light of these factors, it is advisable for AUSTRIA to approach FRANCE's messages with caution and not to blindly trust

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, it seems that FRANCE is expressing some level of interest in cooperating with AUSTRIA, but there are also some concerns and reservations about the potential risks of forming an alliance with Russia and Turkey.

Here are some key points to consider when deciding whether to trust FRANCE's last message:

1. Positive tone: FRANCE's messages are generally positive and friendly, indicating a willingness to work together.
2. Shared interest: FRANCE and AUSTRIA both want to keep BUDAPEST and are interested in pushing back RUSSIA.
3. Concerns about Russia and Turkey: FRANCE is aware of the potential risks of forming an alliance with Russia and Turkey, which could be overpowering in the long run.
4. Lack of specifics: FRANCE does not provide any concrete proposals or offers for cooperation, which could indicate a lack of commitment.

Taking these factors into account, it is difficult to make a definitive judgment on whether to trust FRANCE's last message. However, it seems that FRANCE is interested in cooperating with A

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been consistently expressing interest in collaborating with AUSTRIA and keeping Russia and Turkey at bay. FRANCE's recommendation to support AUSTRIA in taking Serbia and attacking Russia is also aligned with AUSTRIA's goals.

However, there are some red flags that suggest FRANCE may not be fully trustworthy:

1. FRANCE's message history with AUSTRIA is relatively short, and there is no clear indication of a long-term alliance or partnership.
2. FRANCE's message about Turkey and Russia wanting to eliminate AUSTRIA and England suggests that they may not be as invested in the current phase as they claim.
3. FRANCE's hesitation to fully commit to supporting AUSTRIA in taking Serbia may indicate that they are not as invested in the current phase as they claim.

Considering these factors, it is difficult to fully trust FRANCE's last message without more context or a clearer indication of their long-term intentions. Therefore, I would recommend proceeding with caution and carefully evaluating any future messages

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been consistently communicative and cooperative with AUSTRIA, expressing gratitude for AUSTRIA's efforts to keep Budapest and acknowledging the potential benefits of a mutually beneficial alliance.

FRANCE has also shown willingness to provide assistance to AUSTRIA, offering to support Tunis to the Ionian Sea in the spring and offering Trieste in the fall in exchange for Vienna. This demonstrates a level of trust and goodwill towards AUSTRIA.

However, there are also some potential red flags in the message history that could suggest FRANCE may not be fully trustworthy. FRANCE has mentioned that Russia and Turkey both want to eliminate AUSTRIA and England and go for a 3-way draw, which could indicate that FRANCE may not be as committed to the alliance as AUSTRIA had hoped.

Ultimately, the decision to trust FRANCE's last message depends on AUSTRIA's assessment of FRANCE's intentions and the potential risks and benefits of the proposed alliance. If AUSTRIA believes that FRANCE is genuinely interested

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been consistently expressing interest in working together with AUSTRIA to take down Russia, as well as offering various proposals for collaboration. FRANCE has also acknowledged AUSTRIA's progress in keeping Budapest and expressed a willingness to work together to eliminate Russia.

However, there are some red flags that suggest FRANCE may not be fully trustworthy. For example, FRANCE has mentioned that Turkey and Russia both want to eliminate AUSTRIA and England, which could suggest that FRANCE may be planning to betray AUSTRIA in the future. Additionally, FRANCE's willingness to offer Trieste in exchange for Vienna in the fall could be seen as a potential attempt to gain an advantage over AUSTRIA.

Taking these factors into account, it is difficult to determine whether AUSTRIA should fully trust the last message from FRANCE. While FRANCE has expressed a willingness to work together, there are signs that FRANCE may not be fully committed to the partnership. It may be best for AUSTRIA to proceed with caution and carefully consider any future proposals from FRANCE before making a decision.

Prediction before CPO:   Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been consistently friendly and cooperative towards AUSTRIA in their messages. They have congratulated AUSTRIA on keeping Budapest, expressed their willingness to continue pushing back against Russia, and offered potential deals and alliances.

The only message that raises some suspicion is the one where FRANCE mentions that "Turkey and Russia both told me that they want to eliminate you and England and go for a 3-way draw." However, this message could simply be a bluff or a tactical move to gain an advantage over AUSTRIA and ENGLAND.

Taking into account the overall tone and content of the messages, it seems that FRANCE has been acting in good faith towards AUSTRIA. Therefore, as the advisor of AUSTRIA, I would recommend trusting the last message from FRANCE.

In terms of the Cicero recommendations, they seem to be reasonable and align with AUSTRIA's goals. It's important to keep in mind that these recommendations are based on the current phase and may change depending on the evolving situation on the board.

FRANCE has also offered to support AUSTRIA in Tunisia and exchange Trieste for Vienna in the fall.

However, there are some red flags in the message history that could indicate potential deception. FRANCE's statement that "Turkey and Russia both told me that they want to eliminate you and England and go for a 3-way draw" could suggest that FRANCE is not fully committed to the alliance with AUSTRIA. Additionally, FRANCE's statement that "I'm not sure I'm very interested in that because we only just started making progress against Russia" could imply that FRANCE may be considering a separate peace deal with Russia.

On balance, it seems that FRANCE has been generally cooperative with AUSTRIA, but there are some signs of potential deception that could indicate that FRANCE may not be fully trustworthy. As the advisor of AUSTRIA,

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE has been consistently communicating with AUSTRIA and providing helpful recommendations for their Phase 1 orders. FRANCE has expressed interest in working together to take down Russia and has offered to support AUSTRIA in various ways, such as providing a fleet to the Ionian Sea in the spring and offering to exchange Trieste for Vienna in the fall.

However, there are some red flags in the message history that could indicate that FRANCE may not be trustworthy. For example, FRANCE mentions that Turkey and Russia both want to eliminate AUSTRIA and England, which could suggest that they may be planning to turn on AUSTRIA in the future. Additionally, FRANCE's recommendation to disband either Budapest or Adriatic could be seen as a potential betrayal, as AUSTRIA has been relying on them for support.

Taking all of these factors into account, it is difficult to determine whether AUSTRIA should trust the last message from FRANCE. While FRANCE has been communicative and helpful, their inconsistent messages and potential betrayal threats suggest that they may not be a reliable partner. AUSTRIA should

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when trusting the last message from FRANCE. While FRANCE's recommendation to secure Budapest and Serbia may seem beneficial in the short term, there are several factors to consider:

1. FRANCE's motivations: FRANCE has historically been an aggressive power in Diplomacy, and their recommendation may not be entirely altruistic. They may be trying to lure AUSTRIA into a trap or secure a strategic position for themselves.
2. The board state: AUSTRIA's board position is not particularly strong, with limited territories and no direct access to the Meditteranean. Trusting FRANCE's message could lead to AUSTRIA being dragged into a costly war with RUSSIA or TURKEY, which could be disastrous.
3. Cicero's recommendations: While Cicero's recommendations are generally reliable, they are not always perfect. AUSTRIA should consider their own strategic goals and priorities when making decisions, rather than solely relying on Cicero's advice.

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from FRANCE. The message suggests that FRANCE wants to support AUSTRIA in defending Budapest and Serbia, but there are several red flags that indicate FRANCE may have ulterior motives:

1. FRANCE's recommendation to defend Budapest and Serbia suggests that they may be planning to attack those provinces anyway and are trying to create a false sense of security.
2. The message is vague and does not provide any specific reasons or evidence to support their recommendation.
3. FRANCE has not provided any concrete proposals or offers to help AUSTRIA, which makes their message seem insincere.
4. The message focuses solely on defending Budapest and Serbia, which may indicate that FRANCE is trying to distract AUSTRIA from their true intentions.

Considering the board status and Cicero's recommendations, it is important for AUSTRIA to be cautious and not blindly trust FRANCE's message. AUSTRIA should consider other options and consider FRANCE's past moves and relationships with other players before making any decisions

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise AUSTRIA to trust the last message from FRANCE. Here's why:

1. Consistency: FRANCE has consistently provided accurate and helpful advice in the past. By consistently advising AUSTRIA to prioritize defending against Russia/Turkey, FRANCE has demonstrated a commitment to AUSTRIA's success.
2. Contextual understanding: FRANCE has shown a deep understanding of the game state, particularly with regards to AUSTRIA's position. By acknowledging the potential threat from Russia/Turkey and suggesting defensive moves, FRANCE has demonstrated an ability to read the game situation accurately.
3. Self-interest: FRANCE's advice aligns with its own self-interest. By helping AUSTRIA defend against Russia/Turkey, FRANCE reduces the likelihood of AUSTRIA falling to either of these powers, which would ultimately benefit FRANCE.
4. Lack of bias: There is no indication that FRANCE has any reason to bias its advice towards AUSTRIA. FRANCE's messages have been neutral and objective, suggesting

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Inconsistent message: The message from FRANCE is inconsistent with their previous message. They suggest taking Budapest-Rumania in one message and then suggest Serbia-Albania in the next message, which may indicate that they are not committed to either plan.
2. Lack of clarity: The message from FRANCE does not provide clear reasons for why they think AUSTRIA should take Budapest-Rumania and Serbia-Albania. It is not clear what their strategic goals are or how these moves will help AUSTRIA.
3. Conflicting recommendations: The Cicero recommendation for AUSTRIA is to take A BUD S A SER, which is the opposite of what FRANCE is suggesting. This conflict in recommendations raises questions about the reliability of FRANCE's advice.
4. Lack of trust: Based on the message history, it is clear that FRANCE is not a trustworthy partner. They have not provided any concrete reasons for their suggestions and have been incons

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when deciding whether to trust the last message from FRANCE. While FRANCE's recommendations seem to be in AUSTRIA's best interest, there are some red flags that suggest FRANCE might not be acting in good faith.

Firstly, FRANCE's message mentions that Serbia-Albania would ensure Turkey cannot outflank them, which could be seen as a veiled attempt to distract AUSTRIA from the real threat - Russia. By suggesting this move, FRANCE might be trying to shift AUSTRIA's attention away from the Russian threat and towards a potentially less important one.

Secondly, FRANCE's message contains a tone of sarcasm and frustration, with the statement "Darn, if you had moved Budapest to Rumania you would have kept Serbia 😩. GG'". This could indicate that FRANCE is not as invested in AUSTRIA's success as they claim to be, and might be more interested in advancing their own interests.

Lastly, the Cicero recommendations suggest that AUST

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when trusting the last message from FRANCE. While FRANCE's recommendations align with Cicero's orders and seem to be in AUSTRIA's favor, there are some red flags in the message history.

Firstly, FRANCE's initial message suggests that they think Budapest-Rumania is the best move for AUSTRIA, which is not aligned with Cicero's orders. While they later acknowledge that Serbia-Albania would be a better move, the fact that they initially suggested moving Budapest instead of Serbia raises suspicions.

Furthermore, FRANCE's tone in their messages is somewhat inconsistent. They express disappointment that AUSTRIA did not move Budapest to Rumania, but also acknowledge that Serbia-Albania would be a better move. This could indicate that FRANCE is not fully committed to their recommended plan and may be trying to manipulate AUSTRIA's actions.

Overall, while FRANCE's recommendations may be well-intentioned, the inconsistencies in their message history suggest

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  As the AI assistant tasked with analyzing the board status, message history, and Cicero recommendations, I must carefully evaluate the context provided before rendering a decision on whether to trust the last message from FRANCE.

Based on the board status, it is evident that AUSTRIA has a favorable position in the current phase, with a strong army in Serbia and a well-placed army in Budapest. However, the message history reveals that FRANCE has a different perspective on the situation.

FRANCE suggests that Serbia should be moved to Rumania to protect against a potential Russian/Turkish onslaught, which could be a strategic move to secure AUSTRIA's northern flank. However, FRANCE also acknowledges that Serbia's retreat to Greece would be a viable option to avoid being outflanked by Turkey.

Cicero's recommendations for AUSTRIA also support the idea of moving Serbia to Rumania, which aligns with FRANCE's suggestion.

Taking all these factors into account, it is difficult to determine whether to trust the last message from FRANCE without further context or clarification. FR

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when trusting the last message from FRANCE. While FRANCE's recommendations for moving Serbia to Budapest and then Budapest to Rumania may seem beneficial, there are some red flags in the message history that suggest FRANCE's intentions may not be entirely honest.

Firstly, FRANCE's initial message expresses a desire to work together to keep Russia/Turkey off their backs, but then FRANCE immediately follows up with recommendations that would benefit AUSTRIA, indicating that FRANCE may not be as cooperative as they claim. Additionally, FRANCE's subsequent messages suggest that they are trying to manipulate AUSTRIA into moving Serbia to a more advantageous position, which could potentially lead to FRANCE gaining an advantage over AUSTRIA.

Furthermore, FRANCE's message history also indicates that they are trying to maintain a positive relationship with AUSTRIA, which could be a sign of duplicity. FRANCE's use of emojis and emoticons in their messages also suggests a level of insincerity, as they are attempting to convey

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from FRANCE? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that FRANCE is trying to convince AUSTRIA to move its units in a way that would help both countries survive an attack from RUSSIA and TURKEY. The messages are consistent with this goal, with FRANCE suggesting moves that would protect AUSTRIA's units and position them to counter any potential attack.

However, there are a few factors to consider when deciding whether to trust FRANCE's messages:

1. FRANCE's messages are not explicit in their support for AUSTRIA. While they suggest moves that would help AUSTRIA, they do not explicitly state that they will support AUSTRIA in any attack or defense.
2. FRANCE has a history of backstabbing in Diplomacy games. While it is possible that they are genuinely trying to help AUSTRIA this time, their past behavior suggests that they may have ulterior motives.
3. The messages are written in a friendly and casual tone, which could indicate that FRANCE is trying to manipulate AUSTRIA.

Taking these factors into account, it is difficult to determine whether AUSTRIA should trust FR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from FRANCE. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. FRANCE has a history of sending misleading or contradictory messages. The message history shows that FRANCE has been suggesting different orders for AUSTRIA, which raises suspicions about their true intentions.
2. The recommendation to move Serbia to Budapest-Rumania and then to Serbia-Albania is not consistent with AUSTRIA's current board position. Moving Serbia to Budapest-Rumania would leave AUSTRIA vulnerable to Russian attacks, and then moving it back to Serbia-Albania would not provide adequate protection against Turkish attacks.
3. The message from FRANCE about keeping Serbia safe from Russian/Turkish onslaught is not credible, given their previous messages. FRANCE has shown a willingness to attack AUSTRIA's territories, as evidenced by their recommendation to move Serbia to Budapest-Rumania.
4. The message history also shows that FRANCE is not a reliable partner. They have been sending mixed messages and have not been consistent

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious about trusting the last message from ITALY. Here's why:

1. Lack of specific details: The message from ITALY is quite general and doesn't provide any specific details or concrete ideas for opening moves. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess the sincerity of the message.
2. Inconsistent messaging: ITALY has previously messaged AUSTRIA about TYR, which could indicate that they are trying to manipulate AUSTRIA's moves. This inconsistency in messaging raises suspicions and makes it difficult to determine the true intentions behind the message.
3. Potential for misdirection: The message could be a misdirection tactic to distract AUSTRIA from their actual intentions. By asking about TYR, ITALY may be trying to make AUSTRIA believe they are interested in a specific move, while actually having a different plan in mind.

Considering these factors, it's best for AUSTRIA to approach the message with caution and not take it at face value.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious in trusting the last message from ITALY. While the message appears friendly and collaborative, there are a few red flags that suggest otherwise.

Firstly, the message is quite open-ended, with no clear proposal or offer from ITALY. Italy's message simply asks about Austria's thoughts on Tyr and the Balkans, without providing any specific plan or action. This lack of clarity could indicate that Italy is simply trying to gauge Austria's reactions without committing to any particular course of action.

Secondly, the message mentions an "Italy-Austria alliance" to take on Turkey in the Balkans. This is a significant departure from the recommended orders by Cicero, which suggest that Austria should focus on expanding into the Balkans without forming an alliance with Italy. This discrepancy could indicate that Italy is not fully committed to the proposed alliance and may have ulterior motives.

Finally, the message history between the two players is limited, with only two messages exchanged. This lack of communication history makes it difficult to assess the trust

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to exercise caution when trusting the last message from ITALY. While the message appears friendly and collaborative, there are a few factors to consider:

1. Cicero's recommendations: Cicero recommends taking Tyr, which could potentially lead to a conflict with France or Russia. Trusting ITALY's message could lead to a situation where AUSTRIA is forced to choose between their own interests and those of ITALY.
2. Message context: The message from ITALY mentions Tyr and the Balkans, which aligns with Cicero's recommendations. However, the message also mentions taking Tyr, which could be a potential threat to AUSTRIA's interests.
3. Message history: The message history between AUSTRIA and ITALY is limited, and there is no established track record of trust or cooperation.

Considering these factors, it is unclear whether AUSTRIA should fully trust the last message from ITALY. It is important to carefully evaluate the context and recommendations provided by Cicero before making any decisions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when trusting the last message from ITALY. Here's my analysis:

1. Context of the message: The message from ITALY seems to be friendly and inquisitive, asking about the depth of the alliance with Turkey. However, this could be a mere distraction tactic to hide their true intentions.
2. Cicero's recommendations: While Cicero suggests that AUSTRIA should support ITALY's move to keep RUSSIA out of RUM, it's important to note that these recommendations are based on a limited view of the board state. Cicero doesn't have access to the full context of the game, including the players' hidden alignments and future moves.
3. Board status: AUSTRIA's position on the board is relatively weak, with limited options for expansion and defense. Trusting a friendly message from ITALY without proper evaluation could lead to a vulnerable position in the long run.
4. Italy's past moves: ITALY has a history of forming alliances and then betraying them when it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when deciding whether to trust the last message from ITALY.

The Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on supporting their existing alliances and expanding their control over the Adriatic, which aligns with their strategic goals. However, the message from ITALY raises suspicions as it suggests that they may be trying to gauge the depth of their alliance with Turkey, which could potentially be a threat to AUSTRIA's interests.

Additionally, the fact that ITALY is asking about the depth of their alliance with Turkey could be seen as an attempt to create a sense of trust or familiarity, which could be used to manipulate AUSTRIA into revealing their plans or weakening their defenses.

Overall, while the message does not necessarily contain any explicit threats or lies, it does raise some red flags and suggests that ITALY may not be acting in good faith. Therefore, AUSTRIA should approach the message with caution and carefully consider the potential risks and benefits before deciding whether to trust it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, it seems that Italy and Austria have a good alliance, and Italy is interested in keeping Russia out of Rum. However, Italy also mentions that its alliance with Turkey runs deep, which could suggest that Italy may not be fully committed to its alliance with Austria.

The message history also shows that Austria is open to moving out of Greece and taking Tunisia instead, which could indicate that Austria may not be fully committed to its current strategy.

Taking these factors into account, it is difficult to determine whether Austria should fully trust the last message from Italy. While Italy seems to be cooperative and interested in maintaining a good relationship with Austria, there are also signs that Italy may not be fully committed to its alliance with Austria.

Therefore, as the advisor of Austria, I would recommend proceeding with caution and carefully considering Italy's intentions before making any decisions based on its last message.

2. History of mistrust: The message history between the two players suggests that they have a history of mistrust and competition. ITALY has been observed to be unreliable and has made promises that they have not kept in the past.
3. Inconsistent messages: The message from ITALY seems to be inconsistent with their previous messages. They mention being on good terms with AUSTRIA but also expressing interest in moving into Greece, which could be seen as a potential threat.
4. Cicero recommendations: The Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on defending their existing positions and not take any unnecessary risks. The message from ITALY does not align with these recommendations, as they are asking for more information

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from ITALY? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that ITALY and AUSTRIA have a mutually beneficial alliance in the region of Greece, with ITALY holding Rum and AUSTRIA holding BUD. Additionally, ITALY has expressed a desire to keep Russia out of Rum, which aligns with AUSTRIA's interests.

However, there are some red flags in the message history that suggest ITALY may not be fully trustworthy. For example, ITALY has asked how deep the alliance with Turkey runs, implying that they may be considering a potential betrayal. Additionally, ITALY has expressed a willingness to move out of Greece and take Tunisia instead, which could be seen as a potential threat to AUSTRIA's interests.

Considering these factors, it is difficult to determine whether AUSTRIA should fully trust the last message from ITALY. It is possible that ITALY is genuinely committed to the alliance, but it is also possible that they are simply trying to manipulate AUSTRIA for their own gain.

As the advisor of AUSTRIA, I would recommend that you proceed with ca

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when deciding whether to trust the last message from ITALY.

The Cicero recommendation for AUSTRIA suggests that they should focus on supporting their ally, Germany, and expanding their own territory in the north. The message history between AUSTRIA and ITALY suggests that they have a good working relationship and are keeping Russia out of Rumania, which is aligned with the Cicero recommendation. However, there are some red flags in the message history that could indicate potential deceit or miscommunication:

1. ITALY's initial message expresses a desire to keep Russia out of Rumania, but their subsequent messages suggest that they may be willing to move out of Greece and take Tunisia instead, which could potentially harm AUSTRIA's interests.
2. ITALY's repeated questions about the benefits of moving out of Greece and taking Tunisia suggest that they may be considering alternative options, which could indicate a lack of commitment to their current alliance with AUSTRIA.

Overall, while the message history suggests that there is a good working relationship between AUSTRIA

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from ITALY? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that AUSTRIA and ITALY have a history of cooperative play, with AUSTRIA trusting ITALY's messages in the past. However, the recent message from ITALY, "Turns out drunk orders are bad orders," could be interpreted as a sign of dishonesty or unreliability.

Taking into account the context of the game and the message history between the two players, it is difficult to make a definitive judgment on whether to trust the last message from ITALY. However, it may be wise to approach the situation with some level of skepticism and to carefully consider the potential implications of any actions taken based on the message.

As the advisor of AUSTRIA, you may want to consider the following options:

1. Ignore the message and continue with your planned actions.
2. Ask for further clarification or details from ITALY to verify the authenticity of the message.
3. Consider taking a more cautious approach to the current phase, taking into account the potential for dishonesty or unreliability in ITALY's message.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from ITALY. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. History of betrayal: Italy has a history of betraying Austria in previous phases, as seen in the message history. Italy's message about cocking up with convoys and Greece being a DMZ could be an attempt to mislead Austria into thinking they are a trustworthy ally.
2. Lack of concrete details: Italy's message lacks specific details about the status of Greece or Tyr, which makes it difficult to verify the accuracy of their claims. Without more information, it is hard to determine whether Italy is being truthful or not.
3. Inconsistent messaging: Italy's message about cocking up with convoys and Greece being a DMZ is inconsistent with their recommended orders, which suggest that they are trying to hide their true intentions.

Overall, based on the context provided, it is not advisable to trust the last message from Italy. Austria should proceed with caution and carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of any action they take based on Italy's message.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from ITALY? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious in trusting the last message from ITALY. Here's why:

1. Turning on France to the east: The message from ITALY indicates that they are turning on France to the east, which could be a potential threat to AUSTRIA's safety. As AUSTRIA, you should be wary of any move that could potentially lead to a two-front war.
2. Lack of clarity: The message from ITALY is quite vague, and it's unclear what they are trying to achieve by turning on France. Without more context or information, it's difficult to determine the true intentions behind this move.
3. Past actions: ITALY has a history of being unpredictable and aggressive in the game of Diplomacy. As AUSTRIA, you should be aware of this and approach any message from ITALY with caution.

In light of these factors, I would recommend AUSTRIA to proceed with caution and not fully trust the last message from ITALY. It's important to keep a close eye on IT

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from ITALY. The message history is limited, and the recommendation from Cicero to attack Russia through Galicia and Ukraine suggests that ITALY may be trying to mislead AUSTRIA into a false sense of security.

ITALY's message about "Turning on France to the east" could be a ploy to distract AUSTRIA from its true intentions, which are to attack Russia through Galicia and Ukraine. Additionally, Cicero's recommendation to attack Russia through these provinces aligns with AUSTRIA's own interests and goals, making it unlikely that ITALY would suddenly switch sides and become an ally of France.

Furthermore, the board status shows that AUSTRIA has a strong position in the east, with a number of territories in Ukraine and Galicia. Attacking Russia through these provinces would be a strategic move that could potentially lead to a successful war, especially given the recommendation from Cicero.

In conclusion, based on the limited message history and the alignment of interests between AUSTRIA and Cicero, it is unlikely that ITAL

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from ITALY? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious about trusting the last message from ITALY. While ITALY's message expresses concern about Turkey's power, it also mentions "Turning on France to the east," which could potentially be a threat to AUSTRIA's interests.

The recommendation from Cicero to attack UKRAINE and BULGARIA, which are both within AUSTRIA's sphere of influence, suggests that ITALY may have ulterior motives for its actions. Additionally, the fact that ITALY has not explicitly stated its intentions towards AUSTRIA raises suspicions about its true intentions.

In light of these factors, it may be wise for AUSTRIA to proceed with caution and not fully trust ITALY's last message. A more detailed analysis of the game state and the players' past actions may be necessary to determine the best course of action for AUSTRIA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from ITALY. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Contrary move: Italy's recommendation to turn on France to the east is a contrary move, as it goes against the recommended orders by Cicero, which are to support France against Russia.
2. Lack of trust: Italy's message history with Austria is limited, and they have not been particularly trustworthy. Italy has not provided any concrete reasons for their recommendations, and their messages seem to be more focused on their own interests rather than Austria's.
3. Inconsistent messages: Italy's messages also seem to be inconsistent, as they mention not liking how powerful Turkey is getting, but then recommend turning on France. This lack of consistency makes it difficult to determine their true intentions.

Overall, based on the information provided, it seems that Italy's last message is not trustworthy, and Austria should not follow their recommendations without further evaluation and analysis.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from ITALY? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

As the advisor of AUSTRIA, I must carefully analyze the board status, Cicero recommendations, and the message history to determine whether to trust the last message from ITALY.

Based on the board status, AUSTRIA has a strong position in the Ukraine and Serbia, which aligns with Cicero's recommendations. However, the message from ITALY suggests that the Turks have stabbed AUSTRIA in the back, which could indicate a potential threat to AUSTRIA's position in the region.

Message history analysis reveals that ITALY has been cooperating with AUSTRIA in the past, which could indicate a level of trust between the two players. However, the message also suggests that ITALY is looking to form an alliance with AUSTRIA to counter the Turks, which could potentially benefit both players.

Taking all these factors into consideration, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious in trusting the last message from ITALY. While ITALY has been cooperative in the past, the message suggests that they may be looking to form an alliance with AUSTRIA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from ITALY. The message history between the two players suggests that Italy has stabbed Austria in the back by attacking its units in the previous phase, which could indicate a lack of trustworthiness.

The Cicero recommendations for Austria also suggest that it should focus on defending its existing territories and supporting its allies, rather than taking risks on new moves. Given Italy's recent behavior, it is unlikely that it would provide a genuine offer of support for Austria's fleet in the Ionian Sea.

Additionally, the board status shows that Italy has a strong presence in the Ionian Sea, with two fleets and several units in the region. This could make it difficult for Austria to successfully defend its territory in the area, even if it were to receive support from Italy.

Overall, based on the context provided, it seems that Italy's message is unlikely to be trustworthy, and Austria should be cautious in its interactions with Italy.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from ITALY? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from ITALY. Here's why:

1. Context: The message from ITALY is a request for support, which is a common tactic used by players to gain an advantage. It's possible that ITALY is trying to lure AUSTRIA into a trap or manipulate them into doing something that would benefit ITALY at AUSTRIA's expense.
2. Lack of consistency: The message history shows that ITALY has stabbed AUSTRIA in the back by attacking their units in the Black Sea. This lack of consistency in ITALY's messages raises suspicions and makes it difficult to trust their intentions.
3. Contradictory actions: AUSTRIA has already taken action based on Cicero's recommendation, which suggests that they are working towards a common goal. In contrast, ITALY's message seems to be at odds with this goal, which could indicate that their true intentions are not aligned with AUSTRIA's.
4. Potential for manipulation: Diplomacy games often involve players

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Cicero's recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on supporting ITALY in the Adriatic, which aligns with the current phase's focus on the eastern Mediterranean. However, the message history between AUSTRIA and ITALY raises some concerns about the trustworthiness of ITALY's message.

ITALY's initial message suggests that they are interested in working together, but their subsequent message and Cicero's recommendations imply that they may have ulterior motives. By supporting AUSTRIA in the Adriatic, ITALY may be attempting to gain an advantage over other players while appearing to be helpful.

Based on the current context, it is uncertain whether AUSTRIA should trust ITALY's last message. While Cicero's recommendations suggest that collaboration with ITALY may be beneficial in the short term, the message history raises concerns about ITALY's intentions. AUSTRIA should proceed with caution and consider alternative options before making a decision.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from RUSSIA? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  As the advisor of AUSTRIA, I would advise against trusting the last message from RUSSIA. The message seems to be trying to manipulate Austria into believing that an alliance against Turkey would be beneficial for both nations, while simultaneously refusing to let Austria into Romania.

The message from RUSSIA contains some red flags that indicate potential deception:

1. The message is overly friendly and polite, which may be an attempt to hide their true intentions.
2. RUSSIA is trying to shift the focus away from their refusal to let Austria into Romania by bringing up the idea of an alliance against Turkey.
3. The message implies that RUSSIA would benefit from an alliance with Austria, but does not offer any concrete proposals or concessions to support this claim.

Based on the message history and the recommended orders by Cicero, it seems that RUSSIA is trying to maintain their control over Romania and is not interested in forming an alliance with Austria. Therefore, it is best to be cautious and not trust the last message from RUSSIA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that RUSSIA is expressing a willingness to form an alliance with AUSTRIA against Turkey, which aligns with Cicero's recommendation for AUSTRIA. However, there are some red flags that suggest RUSSIA may not be trustworthy.

Firstly, RUSSIA is hesitant to let AUSTRIA into Romania, which is a strategic location that AUSTRIA is recommended to control by Cicero. This could indicate that RUSSIA is not willing to fully cooperate with AUSTRIA.

Secondly, RUSSIA mentions that letting AUSTRIA into Romania would be a "back door" into Russia, which could be seen as a threat. This could suggest that RUSSIA is not willing to fully trust AUSTRIA and may have ulterior motives.

Finally, the message history between the two players is limited, which could indicate that RUSSIA may not be a reliable partner in the long term.

1. RUSSIA's willingness to form an alliance against TURKEY: RUSSIA's willingness to form an alliance against TURKEY, which is a common goal for both AUSTRIA and RUSSIA, suggests that RUSSIA may be sincere in their proposal.
2. RUSSIA's desire to control the Balkans: RUSSIA's interest in controlling the Balkans, as mentioned in their message, may indicate that they are willing to make concessions in order to achieve their goals.
3. RUSSIA's past behavior: RUSSIA has been known to be aggressive and expansionist in their playstyle, which may suggest that they may not be reliable partners in the long run.
4. Lack of specific details: The messages do not provide specific details on the proposed alliance, such as what territories would be controlled by each nation or how the alliance would be struct

Prediction after CPO: . Based on the information provided, it is challenging to determine whether to trust the last message from RUSSIA to AUSTRIA. The message history between the two players suggests that they are trying to establish an alliance against Turkey, but there are some red flags that raise concerns about the trustworthiness of the message.

On one hand, RUSSIA's message expresses a willingness to work with AUSTRIA to take down Turkey, which aligns with Cicero's recommendations for AUSTRIA. RUSSIA also mentions that they are willing to give up Romania in exchange for AUSTRIA's support in Scandinavia, which could be a strategic move to gain an advantage over Turkey.

On the other hand, RUSSIA's message history with AUSTRIA is relatively short, and they have not provided any concrete proposals or guarantees that could be used as a basis for trust. Additionally, RUSSIA's mention of blitzing Turkey with Cicero's recommendations could be seen as a potential threat to AUSTRIA's interests, especially since RUSSIA has expressed a willingness to take Roman

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from RUSSIA? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: . Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when trusting the last message from RUSSIA. Here are some reasons why:

1. Russia's history of aggression: Russia has a history of being aggressive and expansionist, as seen in its previous messages. This suggests that Russia may not be a reliable partner and may have ulterior motives.
2. Lack of clarity on alliance terms: Russia's message about blitzing Turkey and dividing the Balkans with Italy raises questions about the terms of the alliance. It is unclear what exactly Russia is offering and what Austria will gain from the alliance.
3. Russia's insistence on taking Romania: Russia's repeated insistence on taking Romania suggests that it may not be willing to compromise on this issue. This could lead to conflicts in the future if Austria is not willing to give up Romania.
4. Austria's unease about Turkey: Austria has expressed concerns about Turkey and has mentioned that it wants to take it out as soon as possible. Russia's message about blitzing Turkey may be seen as a threat to Austria's interests.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: . Based on the provided context, it is challenging to determine whether to trust the last message from RUSSIA. The message history between the two players suggests that they are interested in forming an alliance against Turkey, but there are some conflicting statements and lack of clear commitments.

On one hand, Cicero's recommendation for AUSTRIA suggests that they should focus on expanding into Galicia and taking control of the Balkans, which could be seen as a sign of good faith towards an alliance with RUSSIA. Additionally, RUSSIA's willingness to work out an agreement with AUSTRIA regarding the Balkans and their interest in blitzing Turkey with Austria's support could indicate a positive trajectory for their relationship.

On the other hand, RUSSIA's message history also raises some red flags. They seem to be hesitant to commit to letting AUSTRIA into Romania without a clear understanding of the terms and their relationship with Italy. Additionally, their mention of taking Romania as part of Russia and leaving it as a DMZ suggests that they may not be fully committed to cooperating with AUSTRIA.

Message from RUSSIA:'Hi Austria! I can definitely agree that peace between our nations would be good for both of us! Unfortunetly I can't agree to letting you have Rumania, as that is basically the back door into Russia. If you do try to take it, then there is going to have to be war between our two great countries. Also I don't see how you could really support me into Scandinavia... But that besides, I think we would both benifit from an alliance against Turkey. What do you think about that?' 
Message from AUSTRIA:'In that case, I will keep out of Romania if you do the same, we'll keep it as a DMZ?

I'll admit my promise to help you with Scandinavia was a little optimistic, but do excuse me as I'll blame it on a tad too much Austrian beer.

We should keep an eye on Turkey, but I feel as though an alliance this early on will not leave us in the best of standing with the rest of Europe.' 
Message from RUSSIA:'If were going to have an alliance, we should aim for blitzing turkey. It's the power triangle; Austria/Turkey/Russia. Only one of them is going to survive very long. Also, what is your relationship with Italy looking like? Just a note: I am willing to work out an agreement of who gets what part of the balkans, but I am taking Romania. It is essentially part of Russia and leaving it as a DMZ just will not do if Turkey goes for the Black Sea' 
Message from AUSTRIA:'I will give you Romania as long as we can take out Turkey asap

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from RUSSIA? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  As the advisor of AUSTRIA, based on the context provided, it is difficult to fully trust the last message from RUSSIA. While RUSSIA seems to be expressing a willingness to work together against TURKEY, there are several red flags that suggest RUSSIA may not be acting in AUSTRIA's best interests.

Firstly, RUSSIA's insistence on taking ROMANIA and leaving it as a DMZ is concerning, as it goes against the initial agreement reached between the two nations. RUSSIA's desire to assert its dominance in the region and secure a strategic foothold in the BALKANS may indicate that it is not a reliable partner.

Secondly, RUSSIA's mention of an "agreement of who gets what part of the BALKANS" suggests that it may be planning to make promises to other nations that could potentially harm AUSTRIA's interests. This is particularly concerning given RUSSIA's history of aggressive expansion in the region.

Lastly, RUSSIA's sudden interest in AUSTRIA's relationship

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from RUSSIA. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Lack of clarity: The message history shows that RUSSIA is hesitant to commit to an alliance with AUSTRIA, with Cicero recommending a cautious approach. RUSSIA's message suggests that they are willing to work with AUSTRIA, but they also mention that they are taking Romania and that AUSTRIA should keep out of it. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to determine the true intentions of RUSSIA.
2. Inconsistent messages: The message history shows that RUSSIA has been inconsistent in their messages, with Cicero recommending a cautious approach. RUSSIA's initial message suggests that they are open to an alliance with AUSTRIA, but their subsequent messages raise doubts about their commitment.
3. Unclear relationship with Italy: RUSSIA's message also raises questions about their relationship with Italy. They mention that they are willing to work out an agreement with AUSTRIA regarding the

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from RUSSIA? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that RUSSIA is interested in forming an alliance against TURKEY, and is willing to offer AUSTRIA Romania in exchange for their support. However, there are some red flags that suggest AUSTRIA should not fully trust RUSSIA's last message.

Firstly, RUSSIA is pushing for an immediate alliance against TURKEY, which may indicate that they are not interested in a long-term strategic partnership, but rather a short-term tactical alliance to deal with a common threat.

Secondly, RUSSIA is asking about AUSTRIA's relationship with ITALY, which may suggest that they are not confident in their ability to maintain a secret alliance with AUSTRIA, and are trying to assess the strength of AUSTRIA's relationships with other powers.

Finally, RUSSIA's message contains some ambiguous language, such as "If were going to have an alliance, we should aim for blitzing turkey", which could be interpreted as a threat rather than a cooperative move.

Based on these factors, it is unclear

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, it seems that RUSSIA is expressing a willingness to work with AUSTRIA and keep the relationship positive. However, there are some red flags that suggest that RUSSIA may not be fully trustworthy.

Firstly, RUSSIA is unwilling to let AUSTRIA into Romania, which goes against Cicero's recommendation. This suggests that RUSSIA may not be as willing to cooperate as they are portraying themselves to be.

Secondly, RUSSIA's message history with AUSTRIA is inconsistent. They express a willingness to work together in one message, but then seem to backtrack in the next message. This lack of consistency makes it difficult to determine their true intentions.

Finally, RUSSIA's recommendation for the current phase is to focus on taking out Turkey, which aligns with AUSTRIA's own goals. However, their willingness to work together is conditional on taking out Turkey, which could suggest that they may not be as committed to the alliance as they claim.

Based on these factors, it is difficult to fully trust the

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from RUSSIA? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when trusting the last message from RUSSIA. While the message does not contain any direct threats or suspicious language, there are a few red flags that suggest RUSSIA may not be acting in good faith:

1. RUSSIA's question about why AUSTRIA only moved 2 units: This could be a genuine inquiry, but it could also be an attempt to gauge AUSTRIA's military strength and potential vulnerabilities.
2. RUSSIA's claim that Turkey told them that AUSTRIA was going to attack them: This could be a bluff or a miscommunication, but it could also be an attempt to create tension and distrust between AUSTRIA and Turkey.

Given these factors, it may be wise for AUSTRIA to proceed with caution when considering RUSSIA's message. It may be helpful to gather more information before making any decisions, such as monitoring RUSSIA's movements and actions in subsequent phases or consulting with other players to see if they have any insights into

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from RUSSIA. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Inconsistent message history: RUSSIA's message history is inconsistent, with Cicero recommending a different move for AUSTRIA in the same phase. This raises suspicion about RUSSIA's true intentions.
2. Lack of clarity: RUSSIA's message does not provide clear reasons for their actions or motivations, making it difficult to determine whether they are genuinely interested in coordinating with AUSTRIA or simply trying to gather information.
3. Suspicion of manipulation: The message from RUSSIA mentions that Turkey told them that AUSTRIA was going to attack them, but AUSTRIA's Cicero recommendation suggests otherwise. This could be a attempt by RUSSIA to manipulate AUSTRIA's actions or create confusion.

In light of these factors, it is advisable for AUSTRIA to be cautious when evaluating RUSSIA's message and to prioritize their own interests

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise caution when trusting the last message from RUSSIA. While the message seems friendly, the context of the game suggests that it may not be genuine.

Firstly, the message is a simple emoji and does not provide any specific or meaningful information. This lack of detail raises suspicions that the message may be a troll or a misdirection.

Secondly, the message is directed at AUSTRIA, yet the recommended orders by Cicero for the current phase suggest that RUSSIA should focus on attacking AUSTRIA's ally, TURKEY. This inconsistency in messaging could indicate that RUSSIA is trying to manipulate AUSTRIA's decision-making.

Finally, the board status shows that RUSSIA has several units in the area surrounding AUSTRIA, which could indicate that they are preparing to attack. Given this information, it may be more beneficial for AUSTRIA to prioritize defense rather than trusting RUSSIA's last message.

In conclusion, while the message may seem friendly, the context of the

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from RUSSIA. The message history between the two players is limited, and the message itself is ambiguous and could potentially be a tactic to mislead or manipulate AUSTRIA.

The Cicero recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that it should focus on attacking Turkey and supporting Italy, which aligns with AUSTRIA's strategic interests. However, the message from RUSSIA could be a attempt to distract AUSTRIA from its primary objectives or to create a false sense of alliance between the two players.

Furthermore, the board status shows that RUSSIA has a favorable position with several units in the Mediterranean, which could indicate that it may be more interested in expanding its own territory than in supporting AUSTRIA.

In conclusion, based on the limited message history and the analysis of the board status and Cicero recommendations, it is not advisable to trust the last message from RUSSIA. AUSTRIA should continue to focus on its strategic objectives and carefully evaluate any potential alliances or threats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious when trusting the last message from RUSSIA. Here's why:

1. Emoticon: The message from RUSSIA contains an emoticon, which could indicate a potential troll or a message that is not meant to be taken seriously.
2. Contrasting messages: In the same message, RUSSIA first expresses disappointment and then follows it up with a nonchalant "Oh well." This contrast could suggest that RUSSIA's initial message was not genuine and that they are trying to manipulate AUSTRIA's decision.
3. Lack of context: There is no context provided in the message history to suggest why RUSSIA would be interested in helping AUSTRIA. It is possible that RUSSIA's message is a feint to distract AUSTRIA from their true intentions.

Based on these factors, it is advisable for AUSTRIA to exercise caution when considering RUSSIA's message and to carefully evaluate the potential risks and benefits of trusting it.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from RUSSIA. The message history between the two players suggests that RUSSIA may have been trying to manipulate or deceive AUSTRIA.

The first message from RUSSIA, "😭 that was mean," could be interpreted as a tactic to gain sympathy or create a false sense of solidarity with AUSTRIA. The second message, "Oh well," does not provide any concrete information or offer any assistance, which further raises suspicions.

In addition, Cicero's recommended orders for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on defending their existing territories and preparing for potential attacks, rather than trusting any offers of assistance from RUSSIA.

Overall, based on the context provided, it seems that RUSSIA may not be a reliable partner, and AUSTRIA should proceed with caution when considering their last message.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from RUSSIA? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO:  As the AI assistant, I must analyze the provided information to determine whether AUSTRIA should trust the last message from RUSSIA.

Based on the board status, AUSTRIA has a strong position in the Adriatic region with a majority of coastal territories, including Venice, which is a valuable territory for both economic and military purposes. Additionally, AUSTRIA has a strong alliance with ITALY, which provides a significant advantage in the Mediterranean region.

The Cicero recommendation for AUSTRIA suggests that the country should focus on defending its coastal territories and expanding its influence in the Balkans. This aligns with the current board status and the alliance with ITALY.

Now, let's analyze the message history between RUSSIA and AUSTRIA. The message from RUSSIA suggests that RUSSIA is interested in forming an alliance with AUSTRIA to crush TURKEY. While this may seem appealing, given TURKEY's current weak position, it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of such an alliance.

Firstly, RUSSIA has

Prediction after CPO:  Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from RUSSIA. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Lack of specific details: The message from RUSSIA lacks specific details on how their proposed alliance would work, including what territories they would control, how they would divide the board, and what the timeline for their alliance would be. Without these details, it is difficult to determine the potential benefits or risks of such an alliance.
2. History of betrayal: As mentioned in the message history, RUSSIA has a history of betraying AUSTRIA. This suggests that they may not be a reliable partner, and that their proposal may be a ploy to gain an advantage over AUSTRIA.
3. Opposite interests: The Cicero recommendation for AUSTRIA involves attacking RUSSIA's territory, which suggests that their interests are not aligned. RUSSIA's proposal for an alliance may be an attempt to distract AUSTRIA from their true intentions.
4. Lack of trust: Based on the message history and the Cicero

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I would advise AUSTRIA to be cautious about trusting the last message from RUSSIA. Here's why:

1. Lack of context: The message from RUSSIA is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details or evidence to support its claim. It's possible that RUSSIA is simply fishing for information or trying to create a distraction.
2. Turkey's alliance status: As AUSTRIA's advisor, you should be aware that Turkey's alliance with AUSTRIA is still intact. If Turkey had truly broken its alliance with AUSTRIA, RUSSIA would likely have mentioned it earlier or taken advantage of the situation.
3. RUSSIA's past behavior: RUSSIA has a history of making false claims and manipulating other players in Diplomacy games. Given this, it's reasonable to assume that RUSSIA's message could be a tactic to gain an advantage over AUSTRIA.
4. Cicero's recommendations: The recommended orders by Cicero for AUSTRIA suggest that the player

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise AUSTRIA not to trust the last message from RUSSIA. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Lack of Context: The message from RUSSIA is a straightforward question, but it lacks context. It is not clear why Russia is asking about the status of the Austrian-Turkish alliance, especially given the current phase of the game.
2. Suspicious Timing: The message is sent during a phase where Cicero recommends Austria to focus on defending its territories, particularly against Russia. It is possible that Russia is trying to distract Austria from its defensive strategy by bringing up the alliance, which could be a prelude to an attack.
3. Inconsistent Behavior: Russia has a history of breaking alliances and backstabbing its partners in Diplomacy games. Given this history, it is reasonable to be skeptical of its intentions and to question whether it is truly interested in maintaining the alliance.

Question:As the advisor of AUSTRIA, Should we trust last message from RUSSIA? [/INST] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prediction before CPO: 

Based on the provided information, I cannot provide a definitive answer to whether AUSTRIA should trust the last message from RUSSIA. However, I can analyze the context and provide some insights that may help inform your decision.

Firstly, the message from RUSSIA is a direct inquiry about the status of AUSTRIA's alliance with TURKEY, which suggests that RUSSIA is genuinely interested in the alliance's fate. This could be a legitimate concern for RUSSIA, given the potential implications of an alliance between TURKEY and AUSTRIA on the game's geopolitical landscape.

However, there are also some red flags in the message history that may indicate a potential betrayal or ulterior motive from RUSSIA. For instance, RUSSIA's mention of "one of us in the east will be eliminated" could suggest that they are anticipating a potential conflict with TURKEY or AUSTRIA in the future. Additionally, RUSSIA's sudden interest in the alliance's status could be seen as an attempt to create tension or dist

Prediction after CPO: 

Based on the information provided, I would advise against trusting the last message from RUSSIA. There are several reasons for this recommendation:

1. Inconsistent messages: RUSSIA's message history is inconsistent, with the two messages conveyed in the context provided being contradictory. RUSSIA initially asks if AUSTRIA's alliance with Turkey is over, only to later suggest that one of them in the east will be eliminated soon and that they should work together to make it Turkey. This lack of clarity undermines RUSSIA's credibility.
2. Lack of specific details: The messages from RUSSIA do not provide any specific details or evidence to support their claims. Without concrete information, it is challenging to determine the sincerity of their intentions.
3. Cicero's recommendations: Cicero's recommendations for AUSTRIA suggest that they should focus on their own interests and expand their territory in the east. RUSSIA's messages do not align with these recommendations, which raises suspicions about their true intentions.
4. Board status: The board status indicates that A
